## 📋 INTERVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md Requirements

**CRITICAL**: This file MUST be comprehensive like `roles/data-analyst/INTERVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md`

### Required Sections:

1. **Header with Resources**
   - GitHub repo link
   - Source URL
   - Role-specific note

2. **Question Distribution**
   - All categories with question counts
   - Total count

3. **How to Use Section**
   - Clear 3-step process

4. **Core Meta-Structure (0️⃣)**
   - Role-specific principles
   - Universal answer framework

5. **DETAILED FRAMEWORK FOR EVERY MAJOR CATEGORY**
   - Each category gets its own numbered section (1️⃣, 2️⃣, etc.)
   - **"What they're really testing:"** explanation
   - **ASCII tree mindmap** showing the framework
   - **📌 Quick tip** at the end

### Example Format for Each Category:

```markdown
## 1️⃣ {Category Name}

**What they're really testing:**
{Clear explanation of what interviewers want to see}

**Mindmap**

```
{Category Name}
├─ Step 1
│  ├─ Sub-step 1a
│  ├─ Sub-step 1b
│
├─ Step 2
│  ├─ Sub-step 2a
│  ├─ Sub-step 2b
│
└─ Step 3
   ├─ Sub-step 3a
   ├─ Sub-step 3b
```

📌 **Key tip**: {Actionable advice}

---
```

### Minimum Requirements:

- **At least 10-15 detailed category frameworks** (not just 1-2)
- **ASCII trees for ALL major categories** (those with 5+ questions)
- **Clear, actionable frameworks** (not vague descriptions)
- **Role-specific language** (e.g., DE uses "pipeline", PM uses "user", etc.)

## 📝 Question_Bank.md Requirements

**Format**: `{Role}_Question_Bank.md`

### Structure:

1. **Header**
   - Title with role name
   - Resource links
   - Total question count

2. **For EACH Category**:
   ```markdown
   ================================================================================
   {CATEGORY NAME}
   ================================================================================

   📊 Total Questions: {count}

   🎯 What they're really testing:
   {Clear explanation}

   🗺️  Mental Model Framework:
   ```
   {ASCII tree framework}
   ```

   📝 All {count} Questions:
   1. Question text here
   2. Another question
   ...
   ```

3. **Rich Text Features**:
   - Use **bold** for emphasis
   - Use `code blocks` for technical terms
   - Use emoji headers (📊, 🎯, 🗺️, 📝)
   - Use separator lines (80 equals signs)

## 🎨 ASCII Tree Standards

### Good ASCII Tree Example:

```
Category Name
├─ Main Step 1
│  ├─ Sub-step 1a
│  ├─ Sub-step 1b
│  └─ Sub-step 1c
│
├─ Main Step 2
│  ├─ Sub-step 2a
│  │  ├─ Detail 2a1
│  │  └─ Detail 2a2
│  └─ Sub-step 2b
│
└─ Main Step 3
   ├─ Sub-step 3a
   └─ Sub-step 3b
```

### Rules:
- Use `├─` for branches
- Use `└─` for last item
- Use `│` for vertical continuation
- Add blank line between major sections (with `│`)
- Indent consistently (3 spaces per level)
- Keep it readable and structured

## 🚫 Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Short INTERVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md** (< 200 lines)
   - ❌ BAD: Just meta-structure and 1-2 categories
   - ✅ GOOD: Detailed frameworks for ALL major categories

2. **Missing ASCII Trees**
   - ❌ BAD: Text descriptions only
   - ✅ GOOD: Visual ASCII tree for every category

3. **Vague Frameworks**
   - ❌ BAD: "Think about the problem and solve it"
   - ✅ GOOD: "Step 1: Clarify scope → Step 2: Define metrics → ..."

4. **Inconsistent Format**
   - ❌ BAD: Different emoji, different structure per role
   - ✅ GOOD: Same format as Data Analyst, adapted for role

5. **Plain Text Question Bank**
   - ❌ BAD: Just numbered list of questions
   - ✅ GOOD: Rich text with frameworks, separators, emojis

## 🎯 Role-Specific Adaptations

While maintaining the format, adapt content for each role:

### Data Engineer:
- Focus: Pipelines, scale, batch vs stream
- Keywords: Ingest, transform, store, serve, monitor
- Categories: Data Pipeline Design, System Design, ETL/ELT

### Product Manager:
- Focus: User needs, business impact, trade-offs
- Keywords: User journey, metrics, prioritization
- Categories: Product Design, Product Strategy, Analytical

### Software Engineer:
- Focus: Code quality, algorithms, system design
- Keywords: Complexity, optimization, scalability
- Categories: Coding, DSA, System Design

### Technical Program Manager:
- Focus: Cross-team coordination, execution
- Keywords: Stakeholders, dependencies, delivery
- Categories: Program Sense, Execution, Cross-Functional

## 📊 Success Metrics

A role is "complete" when:

1. **INTERVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md** is as comprehensive as Data Analyst's (400+ lines)
2. **Question_Bank.md** has frameworks embedded for each category
3. **Both files** use rich text formatting (bold, code, emojis)
4. **All major categories** (5+ questions) have detailed ASCII frameworks
5. **Format matches** Data Analyst role exactly

---

## 🔄 When Adding New Roles

1. **Scrape questions** → save to `data/questions_raw.json`
2. **Categorize** → create role-specific categories
3. **Generate frameworks** → write detailed ASCII trees for EACH category
4. **Create INTERVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md** → 400+ lines with ALL frameworks
5. **Create Question_Bank.md** → embed frameworks with questions
6. **Quality check** → compare to Data Analyst format
7. **Update main README.md** → add role to table

---

## 💡 Remember

**Data Analyst role is the gold standard.**

When in doubt, open `roles/data-analyst/INTERVIEW_FRAMEWORK.md` and match that quality and depth.

**Every role deserves the same level of detail and care.**
