# P2A - North Star Metric

**Formula:** `Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails`

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
North Star Metric (NSM)
│
├─ 1) Define NSM
│   ├─ What is THE single metric?
│   │   ├─ User value: What do users care about?
│   │   ├─ Business value: What drives business?
│   │   └─ Alignment: How do they connect?
│   │
│   └─ Why this metric?
│       ├─ Actionable: Can we influence it?
│       ├─ Measurable: Can we track it?
│       └─ Predictive: Does it predict long-term success?
│
├─ 2) Input KPIs
│   ├─ What drives the NSM?
│   │   ├─ User behavior drivers
│   │   ├─ Supply / quality drivers
│   │   └─ Monetization drivers
│   │
│   └─ Controllable levers
│       ├─ What can we change?
│       └─ What moves the NSM?
│
├─ 3) Leading Indicators
│   ├─ Early signals
│   │   ├─ Short-term behaviors
│   │   ├─ Funnel entry / activation signals
│   │   └─ Quality proxies
│   │
│   └─ Why leading?
│       ├─ Faster feedback
│       └─ Predict NSM movement
│
└─ 4) Guardrails
    ├─ What must NOT break?
    │   ├─ User trust
    │   ├─ Long-term health
    │   └─ Cost / abuse / compliance
    │
    └─ Safety metrics
        ├─ Prevent gaming
        └─ Protect against unintended consequences

## 📌 Sample: North Star Metric Question

**Question:**
"What is the north star metric for [Product]?"

**Answer Framework:**

1. **Define NSM**: What is THE single metric that best represents user + business value? What do users care about? What drives business? How do they align? Why this metric? Is it actionable, measurable, and predictive?

2. **Input KPIs**: What drives the NSM? User behavior drivers, supply/quality drivers, monetization drivers. What are the controllable levers? What can we change to move the NSM?

3. **Leading Indicators**: What are the early signals? Short-term behaviors, funnel entry/activation signals, quality proxies. Why are they leading? Faster feedback, predict NSM movement.

4. **Guardrails**: What must NOT break? User trust, long-term health, cost/abuse/compliance. What are the safety metrics? Prevent gaming, protect against unintended consequences.

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **Single metric focus**: One NSM, not 10 metrics
- **User + Business alignment**: Must represent both
- **Actionable**: Can we influence it?
- **Predictive**: Does it predict long-term success?
- **Guardrails**: Always include safety metrics

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **P2B1-P2B9**: Business model-specific KPI ladders (multiple metrics)
- **P1 (Metric Drop)**: Use when NSM is declining
- **P3 (Funnel Analysis)**: Use when NSM involves conversion
