# P13 - Product Design

**Formula:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
Start: Design a product / feature
│
├─ 1) Users
│   ├─ Who are the users?
│   │   ├─ Primary persona
│   │   ├─ Secondary personas
│   │   └─ Edge cases
│   │
│   └─ User context
│       ├─ Demographics
│       ├─ Environment
│       └─ Constraints
│
├─ 2) Jobs
│   ├─ What job-to-be-done?
│   │   ├─ Functional job
│   │   ├─ Emotional job
│   │   └─ Social job
│   │
│   └─ Pain points
│       ├─ Current friction
│       ├─ Unmet needs
│       └─ Desired outcomes
│
├─ 3) Core Loop
│   ├─ User journey
│   │   ├─ Discovery
│   │   ├─ Onboarding
│   │   ├─ Core usage
│   │   └─ Retention
│   │
│   └─ Engagement loop
│       ├─ Trigger
│       ├─ Action
│       ├─ Reward
│       └─ Investment
│
├─ 4) Key Features
│   ├─ Must-have features
│   │   ├─ Core functionality
│   │   └─ Differentiators
│   │
│   └─ Nice-to-have features
│       ├─ Enhancements
│       └─ Future considerations
│
├─ 5) Tradeoffs
│   ├─ Design tradeoffs
│   │   ├─ Simplicity vs Power
│   │   ├─ Speed vs Quality
│   │   └─ Customization vs Ease
│   │
│   └─ Business tradeoffs
│       ├─ User value vs Revenue
│       ├─ Short-term vs Long-term
│       └─ Innovation vs Stability
│
└─ 6) Success Metrics
    ├─ User metrics
    │   ├─ Adoption
    │   ├─ Engagement
    │   └─ Satisfaction
    │
    └─ Business metrics
        ├─ Revenue
        ├─ Growth
        └─ Strategic value

## 📌 Sample: Design a Product

**Question:**
"Design a product for [target users] to [solve problem]."

**Answer Framework:**

1. **Users**: Identify primary and secondary personas, their demographics, context, and constraints.

2. **Jobs**: Define the job-to-be-done (functional, emotional, social) and pain points (current friction, unmet needs, desired outcomes).

3. **Core Loop**: Map the user journey (discovery → onboarding → core usage → retention) and engagement loop (trigger → action → reward → investment).

4. **Key Features**: List must-have features (core functionality, differentiators) and nice-to-have features (enhancements, future considerations).

5. **Tradeoffs**: Discuss design tradeoffs (simplicity vs power, speed vs quality) and business tradeoffs (user value vs revenue, short-term vs long-term).

6. **Success Metrics**: Define user metrics (adoption, engagement, satisfaction) and business metrics (revenue, growth, strategic value).

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **User-centric**: Start with users and their jobs-to-be-done, not features
- **Iterative**: Design for MVP first, then enhance
- **Balanced**: Consider tradeoffs explicitly
- **Measurable**: Define success metrics upfront

- **P6 (Prioritization)**: Use when deciding which features to build first
- **P7 (Tradeoff Framing)**: Use when evaluating design alternatives
