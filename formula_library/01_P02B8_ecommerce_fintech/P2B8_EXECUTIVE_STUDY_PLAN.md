## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why E-commerce/Fintech Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** E-commerce/Fintech products are about **converting visitors to transactions**. Metrics must capture both conversion efficiency (funnel) and transaction value (AOV, repeat purchases) to maximize GMV and revenue.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Transaction-based: revenue from successful purchases/payments
- Funnel-driven: conversion rate is critical
- Trust-dependent: payment success and security matter
- Repeat purchases: LTV from repeat customers

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for E-commerce/Fintech Products
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), Transaction Volume, Revenue, Payment Success Rate
- **Key Insight:** GMV or Transaction Volume is usually the NSM - captures both volume and value
- **Input KPIs:** Conversion Funnel (conversion rate, cart abandonment, checkout completion), Transaction Value (AOV, items per order, repeat purchase rate), Payment Efficiency (payment success rate, processing time, fraud rate)
- **Leading Indicators:** Add-to-cart rate, Payment initiation rate, Search-to-purchase conversion
- **Guardrails:** Fraud prevention, Payment security, Customer trust (refunds, disputes)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Amazon NSM: GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) - total transaction value"
- "Stripe NSM: Payment Success Rate - % of payments that succeed"
- "Shopify NSM: GMV - total sales volume on platform"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for an e-commerce platform
- What metrics would you track for a payment platform?
- How would you measure e-commerce success?
- What are the key metrics for fintech?
- How would you define success for a transaction platform?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `NSM (GMV/Transaction Volume) → Conversion Funnel → Transaction Value → Payment Efficiency → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For e-commerce/fintech products, the NSM is typically GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) or Transaction Volume - it captures both volume and value.

**1️⃣ NSM** → GMV or Transaction Volume - captures both volume and value.

**2️⃣ Conversion Funnel KPIs** → Conversion rate, cart abandonment, checkout completion.

**3️⃣ Transaction Value KPIs** → AOV, items per order, repeat purchase rate.

**4️⃣ Payment Efficiency KPIs** → Payment success rate, processing time, fraud rate.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Fraud prevention (must be effective), payment security (must be secure), customer trust (refunds, disputes must be handled well).

**Key Principle:** Convert visitors to transactions efficiently while maintaining trust.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for e-commerce:** Focus on transactions
  - "NSM: GMV (Gross Merchandise Value)"
  - "Input KPIs: conversion rate, AOV, repeat purchase rate"
  - "Leading indicators: add-to-cart rate, checkout completion"
  - "Guardrails: fraud prevention, payment security, customer trust"

- **Measure payment platform success:** Emphasize reliability
  - "NSM: Payment Success Rate (% of payments that succeed)"
  - "Input KPIs: transaction volume, processing time, fraud rate"
  - "Leading indicators: payment initiation rate, transaction completion"
  - "Guardrails: fraud prevention, payment security, platform reliability"

### BUCKET 2: Conversion Funnel Metrics
**Questions:** ~1 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Funnel Metrics:** Conversion rate, cart abandonment, checkout completion, add-to-cart rate
- **Key Insight:** Each funnel step has drop-off - measure and optimize each step
- **Measurement:** Conversion rate by step, abandonment rate, completion rate
- **Optimization:** Identify biggest drop-off, hypothesize causes, test fixes

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Conversion rate: purchases / visitors - measures funnel efficiency"
- "Cart abandonment: % of carts not completed - measures friction"
- "Checkout completion: % of checkouts completed - measures payment success"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure conversion rate?
- What metrics indicate funnel health?
- How would you reduce cart abandonment?
- What's the relationship between funnel steps?
- How do you optimize checkout?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Conversion Rate → Cart Abandonment → Checkout Completion → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For conversion funnel metrics, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ Conversion Rate** → Purchases / visitors.

**2️⃣ Cart Abandonment** → % of carts not completed.

**3️⃣ Checkout Completion** → % of checkouts completed.

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Add-to-cart rate, checkout initiation rate, payment success rate.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Fraud prevention (must not block legitimate users), payment security (must be secure), user experience (must be smooth).

**Key Principle:** Each funnel step has drop-off - measure each step, identify biggest drop-off, hypothesize causes, test fixes.

### BUCKET 3: Transaction Value & Payment Metrics
**Questions:** ~0 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (Few questions, but important)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Value Metrics:** AOV (Average Order Value), items per order, repeat purchase rate
- **Payment Metrics:** Payment success rate, processing time, fraud rate
- **Key Insight:** Higher AOV and repeat purchases = higher LTV
- **Measurement:** AOV by segment, repeat purchase rate, payment success by method

**Concrete Examples:**
- "AOV: Average Order Value - revenue / orders, higher is better"
- "Repeat purchase rate: % of customers who buy again - measures LTV"
- "Payment success rate: % of payments that succeed - measures reliability"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure AOV?
- What metrics indicate payment health?
- How would you improve repeat purchases?
- What's the relationship between AOV and LTV?
- How do you measure payment success?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `AOV → Repeat Purchase Rate → Payment Success Rate → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For transaction value and payment metrics, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ AOV** → Average Order Value = revenue/orders.

**2️⃣ Repeat Purchase Rate** → % of customers who buy again.

**3️⃣ Payment Success Rate** → % of payments that succeed.

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Items per order, payment method mix, fraud rate.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Fraud prevention (must be effective), payment security (must be secure), customer trust (must be maintained).

**Key Principle:** Higher AOV and repeat purchases = higher LTV - focus on both.

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2B8 (E-COMMERCE/FINTECH METRICS) QUESTIONS

**Look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Keywords:
- "e-commerce", "fintech", "payment", "transaction", "GMV", "AOV", "conversion rate"
- "checkout", "cart abandonment", "payment success", "fraud", "Stripe", "Square"

### Implicit Indicators:
- **Transaction questions:** "GMV", "transaction volume", "payment volume", "revenue"
