# Executive Study Plan: P2B8 - E-commerce / Fintech Metrics
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, business model-specific  
**Time:** 60-90 min  
**Source:** 3 questions → Business model-specific NSM + KPI Ladder

**❤️ = "Hedgehog Answer"** - Your fallback narrative if you know nothing. Master these first!

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why E-commerce/Fintech Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** E-commerce/Fintech products are about **converting visitors to transactions**. Metrics must capture both conversion efficiency (funnel) and transaction value (AOV, repeat purchases) to maximize GMV and revenue.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Transaction-based: revenue from successful purchases/payments
- Funnel-driven: conversion rate is critical
- Trust-dependent: payment success and security matter
- Repeat purchases: LTV from repeat customers

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for E-commerce/Fintech Products
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), Transaction Volume, Revenue, Payment Success Rate
- **Key Insight:** GMV or Transaction Volume is usually the NSM - captures both volume and value
- **Input KPIs:** Conversion Funnel (conversion rate, cart abandonment, checkout completion), Transaction Value (AOV, items per order, repeat purchase rate), Payment Efficiency (payment success rate, processing time, fraud rate)
- **Leading Indicators:** Add-to-cart rate, Payment initiation rate, Search-to-purchase conversion
- **Guardrails:** Fraud prevention, Payment security, Customer trust (refunds, disputes)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Amazon NSM: GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) - total transaction value"
- "Stripe NSM: Payment Success Rate - % of payments that succeed"
- "Shopify NSM: GMV - total sales volume on platform"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for an e-commerce platform
- What metrics would you track for a payment platform?
- How would you measure e-commerce success?
- What are the key metrics for fintech?
- How would you define success for a transaction platform?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For e-commerce/fintech products, the NSM is typically GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) or Transaction Volume - it captures both volume and value. Input KPIs: conversion funnel (conversion rate, cart abandonment, checkout completion), transaction value (AOV, items per order, repeat purchase rate), and payment efficiency (payment success rate, processing time, fraud rate). Leading indicators: add-to-cart rate, payment initiation rate, search-to-purchase conversion. Guardrails: fraud prevention (must be effective), payment security (must be secure), and customer trust (refunds, disputes must be handled well). The key is converting visitors to transactions efficiently while maintaining trust."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for e-commerce:** Focus on transactions → "For e-commerce, NSM: GMV (Gross Merchandise Value). Input KPIs: conversion rate, AOV, repeat purchase rate. Leading indicators: add-to-cart rate, checkout completion. Guardrails: fraud prevention, payment security, customer trust."

- **Measure payment platform success:** Emphasize reliability → "For payment platform, NSM: Payment Success Rate (% of payments that succeed). Input KPIs: transaction volume, processing time, fraud rate. Leading indicators: payment initiation rate, transaction completion. Guardrails: fraud prevention, payment security, platform reliability."

### BUCKET 2: Conversion Funnel Metrics
**Questions:** ~1 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Funnel Metrics:** Conversion rate, cart abandonment, checkout completion, add-to-cart rate
- **Key Insight:** Each funnel step has drop-off - measure and optimize each step
- **Measurement:** Conversion rate by step, abandonment rate, completion rate
- **Optimization:** Identify biggest drop-off, hypothesize causes, test fixes

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Conversion rate: purchases / visitors - measures funnel efficiency"
- "Cart abandonment: % of carts not completed - measures friction"
- "Checkout completion: % of checkouts completed - measures payment success"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure conversion rate?
- What metrics indicate funnel health?
- How would you reduce cart abandonment?
- What's the relationship between funnel steps?
- How do you optimize checkout?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For conversion funnel metrics, I measure conversion rate (purchases/visitors), cart abandonment (% of carts not completed), and checkout completion (% of checkouts completed). Input KPIs: add-to-cart rate, checkout initiation rate, payment success rate. Leading indicators: search-to-product-view, product-view-to-cart, cart-to-checkout. Guardrails: fraud prevention (must not block legitimate users), payment security (must be secure), user experience (must be smooth). Each funnel step has drop-off - I measure each step, identify biggest drop-off, hypothesize causes, and test fixes."

### BUCKET 3: Transaction Value & Payment Metrics
**Questions:** ~0 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (Few questions, but important)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Value Metrics:** AOV (Average Order Value), items per order, repeat purchase rate
- **Payment Metrics:** Payment success rate, processing time, fraud rate
- **Key Insight:** Higher AOV and repeat purchases = higher LTV
- **Measurement:** AOV by segment, repeat purchase rate, payment success by method

**Concrete Examples:**
- "AOV: Average Order Value - revenue / orders, higher is better"
- "Repeat purchase rate: % of customers who buy again - measures LTV"
- "Payment success rate: % of payments that succeed - measures reliability"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure AOV?
- What metrics indicate payment health?
- How would you improve repeat purchases?
- What's the relationship between AOV and LTV?
- How do you measure payment success?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For transaction value and payment metrics, I measure AOV (Average Order Value = revenue/orders), repeat purchase rate (% of customers who buy again), and payment success rate (% of payments that succeed). Input KPIs: items per order, payment method mix, fraud rate. Leading indicators: add-to-cart value, payment initiation rate, first-repeat-purchase rate. Guardrails: fraud prevention (must be effective), payment security (must be secure), customer trust (must be maintained). Higher AOV and repeat purchases = higher LTV - focus on both."
