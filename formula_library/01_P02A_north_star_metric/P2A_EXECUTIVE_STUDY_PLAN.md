# Executive Study Plan: P2A - North Star Metric
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, not per-question  
**Time:** 2-3 hours total across 3 passes  
**Source:** ~50 questions → 1 concept bucket → 1 high-impact bucket

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2A (NORTH STAR METRIC) QUESTIONS

**Even when "north star" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit NSM Keywords:
- "north star metric", "NSM", "single metric", "primary metric", "most important metric"
- "define success", "what metric matters most", "key metric"

### Implicit P2A Indicators:
- **NSM questions:** "What is the north star metric for X?", "Define the primary metric", "What's the most important metric?"
- **Success definition:** "How do you define success?", "What metric represents success?"
- **Single metric focus:** "If you could only track one metric, what would it be?"

### P2A vs P2 Distinction:
- **P2A (North Star Metric):** "What is the north star metric?" → Focus: Single metric definition
- **P2 (NSM + KPI Ladder):** "What metrics for this product?" → Focus: Full KPI ladder (NSM + Input KPIs + Guardrails)

### Red Flags (NOT P2A):
- "What metrics for this product?" → P2 (NSM + KPI Ladder)
- "Orders down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: North Star Metric Definition
**Questions:** ~50 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "What is the north star metric for [Product]?" - core NSM definition framework
- **Framework:** Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails
- **Define NSM:** What is THE single metric? (User value: What do users care about?, Business value: What drives business?, Alignment: How do they connect?), Why this metric? (Actionable: Can we influence it?, Measurable: Can we track it?, Predictive: Does it predict long-term success?)
- **Input KPIs:** What drives the NSM? (User behavior drivers, Supply/quality drivers, Monetization drivers), Controllable levers (What can we change?, What moves the NSM?)
- **Leading Indicators:** Early signals (Short-term behaviors, Funnel entry/activation signals, Quality proxies), Why leading? (Faster feedback, Predict NSM movement)
- **Guardrails:** What must NOT break? (User trust, Long-term health, Cost/abuse/compliance), Safety metrics (Prevent gaming, Protect against unintended consequences)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Airbnb NSM: Nights booked (user value = travel experience, business value = revenue, alignment = both benefit from bookings)"
- "Instagram NSM: Daily active users who share (user value = expression, business value = engagement, alignment = sharing drives growth)"
- "Uber NSM: Completed rides per week (user value = mobility, business value = marketplace health, alignment = rides = value)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q188: Define a north star metric for Airbnb.
- Q193: Define success for TikTok.
- Q33: As a Home Page PM at Netflix, how would you measure the success of your product?
- Q47: As a PM at Meta, what key metrics would you track for Meta's Workplace Chat?
- Q103: As the CEO of WhatsApp, what are the top 5 metrics you should focus on to measure the app's success?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When defining a north star metric, I use Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails.

**1️⃣ Define NSM** → What is THE single metric?
  - **User value:** What do users care about?
  - **Business value:** What drives business?
  - **Alignment:** How do they connect?

**Why this metric?**
  - **Actionable:** Can we influence it?
  - **Measurable:** Can we track it?
  - **Predictive:** Does it predict long-term success?

**2️⃣ Input KPIs** → What drives the NSM?
  - **User behavior drivers:** What user actions move the NSM?
  - **Supply/quality drivers:** What supply/quality factors move it?
  - **Monetization drivers:** What revenue factors move it?

**Controllable levers:** What can we change? What moves the NSM?

**3️⃣ Leading Indicators** → Early signals:
  - **Short-term behaviors:** Actions that predict NSM
  - **Funnel entry/activation signals:** Early engagement indicators
  - **Quality proxies:** Quality metrics that predict NSM

**Why leading?** Faster feedback, predict NSM movement.

**4️⃣ Guardrails** → What must NOT break?
  - **User trust:** Metrics that protect user trust
  - **Long-term health:** Metrics that ensure sustainability
  - **Cost/abuse/compliance:** Metrics that prevent abuse

**Safety metrics:** Prevent gaming, protect against unintended consequences.

**Key Principle:** One NSM that represents both user value and business value, actionable and predictive.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q188 (Airbnb NSM):** Focus on marketplace NSM
  - "Define NSM: User value (guests want great stays, hosts want bookings), Business value (revenue from bookings, marketplace health), Alignment (bookings = both benefit), Why this metric (Actionable: we can influence bookings, Measurable: track bookings, Predictive: predicts long-term success)"
  - "NSM: Nights booked (captures both guest value and host value, drives revenue, actionable)"
  - "Input KPIs: User behavior (search → book → stay), Supply (host listings, quality), Monetization (booking fees, host fees)"
  - "Leading Indicators: Searches, booking intent, host response rate"
  - "Guardrails: User trust (safety, reviews), Long-term health (host satisfaction, guest retention), Cost (fraud, abuse)"

- **Q193 (TikTok NSM):** Focus on content platform NSM
  - "Define NSM: User value (entertainment, discovery, creation), Business value (engagement, ad revenue, growth), Alignment (time spent = engagement = revenue), Why this metric (Actionable: we can influence engagement, Measurable: track time spent, Predictive: predicts retention and revenue)"
  - "NSM: Daily active users who watch 30+ minutes (engagement + retention)"
  - "Input KPIs: User behavior (watch time, shares, creates), Content (creator uploads, quality), Monetization (ad views, engagement)"
  - "Leading Indicators: Video starts, completion rate, shares"
  - "Guardrails: User trust (content safety, privacy), Long-term health (creator satisfaction, user retention), Cost (content moderation, abuse)"
