# Instagram Stories NSM Example (with Feedback)

**Question:** You're a PM for Instagram Stories. What is your North Star Metric, and why?

**Score: 6.5 / 10**

You did a lot of things right, and a few key things held this back from being a strong P2 answer. I'll be precise and fair.

---

## What you did well (this is real signal)

### 1. Correct instinct on what a North Star *is*

You **correctly framed NSM as multi-stakeholder value**:

* creators (posters)
* viewers (consumers)
* platform (retention, time)
* advertisers (optional layer)

That's exactly the *right mental model*. Interviewers like this.

### 2. You naturally covered guardrails

You talked about:

* trust
* spam
* abuse
* privacy
* community guidelines

This maps cleanly to **guardrails**, even though you didn't label it as such. Good.

### 3. You showed product intuition

You referenced:

* relevance
* spam vs value
* creator incentives
* viewer annoyance
* session duration
* comeback rate

That shows **product thinking**, not just analytics.

---

## Where it broke (and why this matters)

### 1. You never clearly **named a single North Star Metric**

This is the biggest issue.

You said:

> "click rate, view rate"

That's **two metrics**, and neither is clearly tied to **Stories' core value**.

For Instagram Stories, interviewers expect **ONE crisp metric**, for example:

* **Daily Active Story Viewers**
* **Stories Viewed per DAU**
* **Daily Story Sessions per User**
* **% of DAU viewing ≥1 story per day**

You hovered around this, but never locked it.

**NSM must be one sentence, one number.**

---

### 2. You mixed NSM, inputs, and tactics together

You talked about:

* captions
* hashtags
* soundtrack
* aspect ratio
* ads optimization

Those are **tactics**, not metrics.

In P2 questions, interviewers want this structure:

```
North Star (1 metric)
↓
Input KPIs (drivers you can move)
↓
Leading indicators (early signals)
↓
Guardrails (what must not break)
```

You described *everything*, but didn't **separate the layers**.

---

### 3. Too long before anchoring

You spoke for a while before saying:

> "So I would say this one should be click rate, view rate"

In interviews, **NSM should come in the first 20–30 seconds**.

---

## What a 9/10 version of *your* answer would sound like

Here's your answer, cleaned up — **this is very close to what you already think**:

> **North Star Metric:**
> *Daily Stories Viewed per Daily Active User (DAU)*
>
> This captures value for all stakeholders:
>
> * Viewers are finding stories worth watching
> * Creators are reaching engaged audiences
> * Instagram benefits from habitual, repeat usage
>
> **Input KPIs:**
>
> * % of DAU viewing at least one story
> * Average stories watched per session
> * Story completion rate
> * Creator posting frequency
>
> **Leading Indicators:**
>
> * First-day story engagement for new users
> * Time to first story view after app open
>
> **Guardrails:**
>
> * Story hide / mute rate
> * Reported or policy-violating content
> * Viewer fatigue signals (rapid skips)
> * Privacy and audience control violations

Notice:
You already *know* all this — you just didn't **structure and name it**.

---

## Verdict (honest)

* **PM interviewer:** passable, mid-level
* **Data / DE interviewer:** solid intuition, needs crisper metric framing
* **Main fix:** say the NSM early, singular, and confidently

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Name the NSM first** — within 20-30 seconds
2. **One metric, not two** — be decisive
3. **Separate layers** — NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails
4. **Don't mix tactics with metrics** — keep tactics separate from the framework

If you want, next we can:

* do **another P2 question** (Airbnb / Stripe / Google Photos), or
* redo this same question once, aiming for **8.5+** in under 2 minutes
