# North Star Metric for Airbnb (using the P2A framework)

---

## 1) Define NSM (THE single metric)

**North Star Metric:**
**Nights Booked with a 5-Star Guest Experience**

*(often operationalized as: completed nights where both guest satisfaction and host quality meet a high bar)*

**Why this works**

* **User value:** Guests want great stays; hosts want reliable, respectful guests.
* **Business value:** More high-quality nights = more revenue + retention on both sides.
* **Alignment:** You can't grow this metric without keeping guests happy *and* hosts healthy.

**Quality bar (example):**

* Guest rating ≥ 4.8
* No trust/safety issues
* Host accepts future bookings (implicit signal of good guest behavior)

## 2) Input KPIs (what drives the NSM)

**Guest-side drivers**

* Search → booking conversion rate
* Availability match (dates, price, location)
* Booking friction (time to book, payment success)

**Host-side drivers**

* Active listings with availability
* Host acceptance rate
* Calendar freshness / response time
* Listing quality score (photos, accuracy)

**Marketplace / monetization drivers**

* Average nightly price × nights
* Take rate stability
* Supply–demand balance by market

**Controllable levers**

* Search ranking & personalization
* Pricing tools (smart pricing, discounts)
* Host incentives & education
* Trust & safety systems

---

## 3) Leading Indicators (early signals)

**Guest leading indicators**

* Search result click-through rate
* Wishlist saves
* Time to first booking after signup
* Repeat booking intent (within 90 days)

**Host leading indicators**

* New host activation rate
* First listing published within X days
* Weekly availability updates
* Response time < 1 hour

**Why these are leading**

* They move **weeks before** nights booked changes
* Faster feedback loops for experiments
* Predict future supply, demand, and quality

---

## 4) Guardrails (what must NOT break)

**Trust & safety**

* Safety incidents per 1k nights
* Fraud / scam rate
* Cancellations due to host issues

**Marketplace health**

* Host churn rate
* Guest complaint rate
* Review inflation / rating gaming

**Cost & compliance**

* Customer support cost per booking
* Regulatory risk flags by city
* Insurance / liability claims

---

## Final NSM Statement (one-liner)

> **Airbnb's North Star Metric is "High-quality nights booked," measuring completed stays that deliver great guest experiences while keeping hosts successful and the marketplace healthy.**

## Next Steps

If you want, I can:

* Rewrite this as an **interview-ready answer**
* Turn it into a **metrics tree diagram**
* Compare this NSM vs alternatives (e.g., GMV, bookings, MAU)
* Adapt it for **Airbnb Experiences** or **long-term stays**
