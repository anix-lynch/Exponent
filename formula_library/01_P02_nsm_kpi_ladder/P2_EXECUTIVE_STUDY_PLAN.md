## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2 (NSM + KPI LADDER) QUESTIONS

**Even when "NSM" or "KPI" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Metrics Keywords:
- "metrics", "KPIs", "north star", "success metrics", "key metrics"
- "how to measure", "define success", "what metrics", "track"

### Implicit P2 Indicators:
- **Definition questions:** "what is the north star metric?", "define success for X", "what metrics matter?"
- **Design + metrics:** "design X and define success", "build X and measure success"
- **Measurement questions:** "how would you measure X?", "what metrics for Y?", "track success"
- **Goal setting:** "set goals for team", "define KPIs", "what metrics to focus on"
- **Success definition:** "how do you define success?", "what does success look like?"

### P2 vs P1 Distinction:
- **P2 (NSM + KPI):** "How would you measure success?" → Focus: DEFINE metrics (NSM → Input KPIs → Guardrails)
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Orders down 25%" → Focus: DIAGNOSE why metric dropped (segment → hypothesize)

### P2 vs P3 Distinction:
- **P2 (NSM + KPI):** "What metrics for this product?" → Focus: DEFINE what to measure
- **P3 (Funnel):** "How to improve conversion?" → Focus: OPTIMIZE existing funnel steps

### Red Flags (NOT P2):
- "X is down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)
- "Users drop at checkout" → P3 (Funnel)
- "Cohort retention declined" → P4 (Cohort/Retention)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Existing Product
**Questions:** ~50 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "What is the north star metric for [Product]?" or "Define success metrics for [Product]"
- **Framework:** NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails → Dashboard
- **Key Insight:** NSM = single metric that captures user value + business value, actionable, predictive
- **Input KPIs:** What drives the NSM? (user behavior, supply/quality, monetization)
- **Guardrails:** What must NOT break? (trust, long-term health, cost/compliance)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Airbnb NSM: Nights booked (user value = travel, business value = revenue)"
- "Instagram NSM: Daily active users who share (engagement + growth)"
- "Uber NSM: Completed rides per week (mobility + marketplace health)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q188: Define a north star metric for Airbnb.
- Q103: As the CEO of WhatsApp, what are the top 5 metrics you should focus on to measure the app's success?
- Q193: Define success for TikTok.
- Q33: As a Home Page PM at Netflix, how would you measure the success of your product?
- Q47: As a PM at Meta, what key metrics would you track for Meta's Workplace Chat?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails → Dashboard`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When defining success for a product, I start with the North Star Metric.

**1️⃣ Define NSM** → Single metric that represents both user value and business value. Must be actionable (we can influence it), measurable (we can track it), and predictive (predicts long-term success).

**2️⃣ Build Input KPIs** → What drives the NSM? User behavior, supply/quality, monetization.

**3️⃣ Add Leading Indicators** → Early signals: short-term behaviors, activation signals.

**4️⃣ Set Guardrails** → What must not break? User trust, long-term health, cost/compliance.

**5️⃣ Design Dashboard** → NSM at top, Input KPIs weekly, Leading Indicators daily, Guardrails as alerts.

**Key Principle:** NSM connects user value to business value - it's the bridge between what users care about and what drives business.

- Q67: As a PM for Meta, how would you measure the success of launching a job marketplace?
- Q113: As the PM at Netflix, after launching Netflix Podcasts 6 months ago, how do you define and measure the success of this initiative?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Define Success Metric → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails → Measure Incrementally`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When measuring feature or product success, I define a success metric that ties to business outcomes.

**1️⃣ Define Success Metric** → For new feature: adoption (weekly active users) OR engagement (feature usage per user).

**2️⃣ Identify Input KPIs** → What drives success? Discovery rate, activation rate, retention.

**3️⃣ Use Leading Indicators** → Early feedback: first-use rate, time-to-first-value.

**4️⃣ Set Guardrails** → Ensure feature doesn't hurt core product metrics.

**5️⃣ Measure Incrementally** → Compare feature users vs non-users, track trends over time, validate with experiments.

**Key Principle:** Tie feature metrics to business outcomes - adoption and engagement must drive business value.

### BUCKET 4: Goal Setting & Team Metrics
**Questions:** ~30 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "How would you set goals for the team?" or "What metrics would you track for [Team/Product]?"
- **Framework:** Align team goals to NSM, break down into Input KPIs, set targets
- **Key Insight:** Goals should be tied to NSM, measurable, time-bound, and team-aligned
- **Approach:** Define team's contribution to NSM → Set goal → Break into Input KPIs → Track progress

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Instagram Stories team goal: Increase Stories creation by 20% (drives NSM: DAU)"
- "Netflix recommendation team goal: Increase recommendation CTR by 15% (drives NSM: watch time)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**

- Q69: As a PM for Spotify Podcasts, what success metrics would you define? If engagement on Spotify Music is down while engagement on Spotify Podcasts is up, what actions would you take?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Align to NSM → Define Team Influence → Set Goal → Break Down → Set Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When setting team goals, I align them to the product's NSM.

**1️⃣ Align to NSM** → Team goals must drive the NSM.

**2️⃣ Define Team Influence** → What can the team directly influence? Usually an Input KPI that drives the NSM.

**3️⃣ Set Goal** → Specific, measurable, time-bound (e.g., increase X by Y% in Z months).

**4️⃣ Break Down** → Leading indicators the team can track daily.

**5️⃣ Set Guardrails** → Ensure we don't optimize for the goal at the expense of other important metrics.

**Key Principle:** Goals connect team work to the bigger picture - communicate how team's work drives NSM.
