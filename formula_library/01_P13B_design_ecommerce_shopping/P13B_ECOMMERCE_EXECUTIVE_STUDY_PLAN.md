## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13B_ECOMMERCE (DESIGN E-COMMERCE/SHOPPING PLATFORMS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "e-commerce" or "shopping" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit E-commerce Keywords:
- "e-commerce", "shopping", "retail", "payment", "checkout", "cart", "purchase"
- "Amazon", "shopping app", "online store", "marketplace" (if single-sided)
- "buy", "sell", "product", "catalog", "inventory", "order"

### Implicit P13B_ECOMMERCE Indicators:
- **Shopping focus:** "Design a shopping app", "Design e-commerce website", "Design payment system"
- **Purchase focus:** "Design checkout", "Design cart", "Design purchase flow"
- **Product focus:** "Design product catalog", "Design product discovery", "Design product search"
- **Payment focus:** "Design payment system", "Design payment screen", "Design payment flow"

### P13B_ECOMMERCE vs P13D Distinction:
- **P13B_ECOMMERCE (E-commerce/Shopping):** "Design a shopping app" → Focus: Single-sided platform, purchase flow
- **P13D (Marketplace):** "Design a marketplace" → Focus: Two-sided platform, supply/demand matching

### P13B_ECOMMERCE vs P13B_CONTENT Distinction:
- **P13B_ECOMMERCE (E-commerce/Shopping):** "Design a shopping app" → Focus: Purchase, transaction, commerce
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption, discovery

### Red Flags (NOT P13B_ECOMMERCE):
- "Design a marketplace" → P13D (Marketplace) - if two-sided
- "Design a video streaming app" → P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media)
- "Design a social media app" → P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: E-commerce Platform Design
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing an e-commerce platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics.

**1️⃣ Users** → Who are the users? (Shoppers/buyers, Sellers/merchants, Platform operators), What are their needs? (Product discovery, Easy purchasing, Trust & safety).

**2️⃣ Jobs** → What jobs do users need done? (Find products, Compare options, Make purchase, Track orders), Prioritize by Purchase intent and Urgency.

**3️⃣ Core Loop** → What is the engagement loop? (Browse/search → Add to cart → Checkout → Return for more), How does it drive retention? (Repeat purchases, Saved preferences).

**4️⃣ Key Features** → Core features (Product catalog, Search/filter, Cart, Checkout, Payment), Supporting features (Reviews, Recommendations, Wishlist, Order tracking).

**5️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Conversion vs experience, Trust vs speed, Features vs simplicity.

**6️⃣ Success Metrics** → Commerce metrics (Conversion rate, AOV, Revenue), Retention metrics (Repeat purchase rate, Customer LTV).

**Key Principle:** Design a platform that makes it easy to discover and purchase products while building trust.

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design checkout" or "Design purchase flow" - same framework, with focus on conversion
- **Approach:** Same e-commerce framework, with focus on purchase flow and checkout optimization
- **Checkout Design:** Flow steps (Cart review, Shipping, Payment, Confirmation), Optimization (Reduce steps, Save progress, Guest checkout, Auto-fill), Trust signals (Security badges, Reviews, Guarantees)
- **Conversion Optimization:** Reduce friction (Fewer fields, Clear pricing, Trust signals), Increase urgency (Limited stock, Time-sensitive offers), Success metrics (Conversion rate, Checkout abandonment, AOV)

**Concrete Examples:**

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop (Conversion Focus) → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When focusing on purchase flow and checkout, I use the same e-commerce framework but emphasize conversion optimization.

**1️⃣ Users & Jobs** → Identify users and their jobs to understand purchase needs.

**2️⃣ Core Loop (Conversion Focus)** → Entry point (How users enter - product page, cart, checkout), Core action (Add to cart, Review, Complete purchase), Reward (Purchase complete, Product received, Satisfaction), Return trigger (Next purchase, Recommendations, Saved preferences).

**3️⃣ Key Features (Conversion)** → Checkout flow (Cart review, Shipping, Payment, Confirmation - minimize steps), Optimization (Reduce friction - fewer fields, guest checkout, auto-fill, Save progress, Clear pricing), Trust signals (Security badges, Reviews, Guarantees, Return policy), Payment (Multiple methods, Saved payments, Security, Fast processing).

**4️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Conversion vs experience (optimize for both), Security vs speed (prioritize security), Features vs simplicity (keep simple).

**5️⃣ Success Metrics** → Conversion metrics (Conversion rate, Checkout abandonment, AOV, Cart abandonment), Commerce (Revenue, Repeat purchases, Customer LTV).

**Key Principle:** Make checkout fast, secure, and trustworthy.
