## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13A (DESIGN CONSUMER / SINGLE-USER PRODUCTS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "design" or "consumer" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Design Keywords:
- "design a", "design an", "design for", "redesign"
- "product for", "app for", "system for"
- Physical products: "alarm clock", "chair", "elevator", "vending machine", "bookshelf"

### Implicit P13A Indicators:
- **Physical product design:** "Design a better X", "Design X for Y", "Design X for [specific user]"
- **Single-user focus:** Products used by one person at a time (not platforms, not marketplaces)
- **Accessibility focus:** "Design X for disabled", "Design X for elderly", "Design X for children"
- **Context-specific:** "Design X for hotels", "Design X for airports", "Design X for [specific environment]"

### P13A vs P13B Distinction:
- **P13A (Single-User Products):** "Design a better alarm clock" → Focus: Physical/single-user product, User Context → Pain Points → Core Design
- **P13B (Consumer Platforms):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Platform with engagement loop, Users → Jobs → Core Loop

### P13A vs P13C Distinction:
- **P13A (Single-User Products):** "Design a better alarm clock" → Focus: Consumer product, single user
- **P13C (B2B/SaaS):** "Design a B2B customer support product" → Focus: Enterprise workflow, User vs Buyer

### P13A vs P13D Distinction:
- **P13A (Single-User Products):** "Design a better alarm clock" → Focus: Single user, no two-sided market
- **P13D (Marketplace):** "Design a bike-sharing system" → Focus: Two-sided platform, supply/demand

### Red Flags (NOT P13A):
- "Design a social media app" → P13B (Consumer Platforms)
- "Design a B2B product" → P13C (B2B/SaaS)
- "Design a marketplace" → P13D (Marketplace)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Physical Product Design
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a better X" or "Design X for Y" - core product design framework
- **Framework:** User Context → Pain Points → Core Design → Tradeoffs → Risks
- **User Context:** Who is the user? (Demographics, physical/mental capabilities, usage environment), What is their current experience? (Existing solutions, pain points)
- **Pain Points:** What problems need solving? (Functional problems, usability issues, accessibility barriers), Prioritize pain points (Frequency, Severity)
- **Core Design:** Key features (Must-have functionality, usability improvements, accessibility features), Design principles (Simplicity, Safety, Durability)
- **Tradeoffs:** Cost vs quality, Features vs simplicity, Customization vs standardization
- **Risks:** Safety risks, Adoption barriers, Manufacturing constraints

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design better alarm clock: User Context (adults who need reliable wake-up, current alarms are jarring or unreliable), Pain Points (hard to set, too loud/quiet, snooze confusion), Core Design (simple interface, gradual volume, smart snooze), Tradeoffs (features vs simplicity), Risks (safety - oversleeping, adoption - learning curve)"
- "Design elevator for blind users: User Context (blind users, need to navigate independently, current elevators rely on visual cues), Pain Points (can't see floor numbers, can't see buttons, don't know when doors open), Core Design (braille buttons, audio announcements, tactile feedback), Tradeoffs (cost vs accessibility), Risks (safety - getting lost, adoption - training needed)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q257: Design a better alarm clock. (general product improvement angle)
- Q276: Design a chair for the disabled. (accessibility design angle)
- Q381: Design a next-generation elevator. (innovation angle)
- Q39: As a PM at a vending machine company, design a new line of vending machines for hotels and motels. (context-specific angle)
- Q267: Design a bookshelf for children. (user-specific design angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When designing a consumer product, I use User Context → Pain Points → Core Design → Tradeoffs → Risks. First, I understand User Context: Who is the user? (Demographics, physical/mental capabilities, usage environment), What is their current experience? (Existing solutions, pain points). Then I identify Pain Points: What problems need solving? (Functional problems, usability issues, accessibility barriers), and prioritize by Frequency and Severity. Next, I design Core Design: Key features (Must-have functionality, usability improvements, accessibility features), Design principles (Simplicity, Safety, Durability). I consider Tradeoffs: Cost vs quality, Features vs simplicity, Customization vs standardization. Finally, I assess Risks: Safety risks, Adoption barriers, Manufacturing constraints. The goal is user-centric design that solves real problems while being simple, safe, and manufacturable."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q257 (Design better alarm clock):** Focus on general improvement → "To design a better alarm clock, I'd: User Context (Adults who need reliable wake-up, current alarms are jarring or unreliable, used in bedrooms), Pain Points (Hard to set, too loud/quiet, snooze confusion, battery dies, hard to see in dark), Core Design (Simple interface with large buttons, gradual volume increase, smart snooze (max 3 times), battery indicator, backlit display), Tradeoffs (Features vs simplicity - keep it simple, Cost vs quality - durable but affordable), Risks (Safety - oversleeping if fails, Adoption - learning curve for new features). I'd prioritize simplicity and reliability over advanced features."

- **Q276 (Design chair for disabled):** Emphasize accessibility → "To design a chair for disabled users, I'd: User Context (Users with mobility limitations, need support and comfort, used in homes/offices), Pain Points (Current chairs don't provide enough support, hard to get in/out, not adjustable, uncomfortable for long periods), Core Design (Ergonomic support (lumbar, armrests), Easy entry/exit (height adjustment, swivel), Comfort features (cushioning, breathable material), Safety features (stability, weight capacity), Adjustability (height, tilt, armrests), Tradeoffs (Features vs simplicity - need features for accessibility, Cost vs quality - must be durable), Risks (Safety - falls, injuries, Adoption - cost, training). I'd prioritize safety and accessibility over cost."

### BUCKET 2: Accessibility & User Context
**Questions:** ~5 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design X for [specific user group]" - accessibility and user-specific design
- **Approach:** Same framework, with focus on accessibility and user constraints
- **Accessibility Design:** Understand user limitations (Physical, mental, sensory), Design for inclusivity (Universal design principles, adaptive features), Test with users (User testing, feedback, iteration)
- **User Context:** Specific user needs (Children, elderly, disabled, specific demographics), Usage environment (Home, public, workplace), Constraints (Physical limitations, cognitive limitations, environmental constraints)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design for children: User Context (children have smaller hands, less strength, need safety, used at home/school), Pain Points (too complex, too heavy, safety concerns, not engaging), Core Design (simple interface, lightweight, safety features, engaging design), Tradeoffs (features vs simplicity - keep simple, Cost vs safety - prioritize safety), Risks (Safety - injuries, Adoption - age-appropriate)"
- "Design for elderly: User Context (elderly have reduced vision/hearing, reduced dexterity, need simplicity, used at home), Pain Points (small text, complex controls, hard to see/hear, physical limitations), Core Design (large text/buttons, simple interface, audio feedback, easy grip, high contrast), Tradeoffs (features vs simplicity - prioritize simplicity, Cost vs accessibility - worth the cost), Risks (Safety - confusion, Adoption - learning curve)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q605: Design an elevator for blind users. (accessibility design angle)
- Q268: Design a bookshelf for elderly people. (elderly-specific design angle)
- Q278: Design a clock for children. (children-specific design angle)
- Q564: Design an alarm clock for children 100 years in the future. (futuristic + children angle)
- Q267: Design a bookshelf for children. (children-specific design angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When designing for specific user groups, I use the same framework but focus on accessibility and user constraints. I understand User Context: Specific user needs (Children, elderly, disabled, specific demographics), Usage environment (Home, public, workplace), Constraints (Physical limitations, cognitive limitations, environmental constraints). I identify Pain Points: What problems do this user group face? (Accessibility barriers, usability issues, safety concerns), Prioritize by impact. I design Core Design: Accessibility features (Universal design, adaptive features, inclusive design), User-specific features (Age-appropriate, ability-appropriate), Safety features (Critical for vulnerable users). I consider Tradeoffs: Features vs simplicity (Keep it simple for accessibility), Cost vs accessibility (Accessibility is worth the cost). I assess Risks: Safety risks (Higher for vulnerable users), Adoption barriers (Learning curve, cost). The goal is inclusive design that works for everyone, especially the target user group."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q605 (Design elevator for blind users):** Focus on accessibility → "To design an elevator for blind users, I'd: User Context (Blind users, need to navigate independently, used in public buildings, constraints: can't see visual cues), Pain Points (Can't see floor numbers, can't see buttons, don't know when doors open, don't know direction), Core Design (Braille buttons with raised numbers, Audio announcements (floor numbers, direction, door status), Tactile feedback (button press confirmation, floor indicators), Voice control option, Large, well-spaced buttons, High contrast for low vision), Tradeoffs (Features vs simplicity - need features for accessibility, Cost vs accessibility - accessibility is worth the cost), Risks (Safety - getting lost, confusion, Adoption - training, cost). I'd prioritize accessibility and safety over cost."
