## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P8 (EXPERIMENT DESIGN) QUESTIONS

**Even when "experiment" or "A/B test" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Experiment Keywords:
- "experiment", "A/B test", "test", "validate", "pilot", "beta"
- "how would you test", "design an experiment", "measure success"

### Implicit P8 Indicators:
- **Testing questions:** "how would you test X?", "how would you validate Y?", "design an experiment for Z"
- **Evaluation questions:** "how would you evaluate X?", "how would you measure success of Y?"
- **Decision questions:** "how do you decide whether to ship X?", "should we launch Y?"
- **Beta/pilot questions:** "how would you pilot X?", "assess success of beta launch"
- **Sample size questions:** "what sample size?", "how many users needed?"

### P8 vs P9 Distinction:
- **P8 (Experiment Design):** "How would you test X?" → Focus: DESIGN experiment (Hypothesis → Metric → Design → Run → Validate)
- **P9 (Decision Under Uncertainty):** "Should we do X with incomplete info?" → Focus: CLARIFY assumptions and validate (Assumptions → Risks → Validation → Decide)

### P8 vs P6 Distinction:
- **P8 (Experiment Design):** "How would you test feature X?" → Focus: DESIGN experiment to test
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "Which features to build first?" → Focus: RANK options using RICE

### Red Flags (NOT P8):
- "Which features to build first?" → P6 (Prioritization)
- "Should we do X with incomplete info?" → P9 (Decision Under Uncertainty)
- "Orders down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Classic A/B Test Design
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "How do you A/B test X?" or "Design an experiment for Y" - core experiment framework
- **Framework:** Hypothesis → Metric → Design → Run → Validate → Decide
- **Hypothesis:** "If we change X for users Y, then outcome Z will change because R"
- **Metric:** Primary (decision metric), Guardrails (prevent harm), Diagnostics (explain why)
- **Design:** Unit of randomization (user/session/geo), Population, Variants (Control/Treatment), Duration, Instrumentation
- **Run:** Ramp (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%), Monitor guardrails, Freeze conflicting changes
- **Validate:** SRM check, Balance check, Correct attribution, No logging changes
- **Decide:** Ship/Iterate/Rollback based on results

**Concrete Examples:**
- "A/B test new feature: Hypothesis (if we add X, then engagement increases), Metric (primary: engagement, guardrails: churn), Design (user randomization, 50/50 split, 2 weeks), Run (ramp gradually), Validate (check SRM, balance), Decide (ship if positive)"
- "Test checkout redesign: Hypothesis (simpler checkout increases conversion), Metric (primary: conversion, guardrails: refunds), Design (user randomization), Run (ramp), Validate (check balance), Decide (ship if conversion up)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1041: How do you A/B test a new feature?
- Q1308: How would you design an experiment to validate the success of a new landing page?
- Q1079: How do you design an experiment to avoid common pitfalls in interpreting results?
- Q1082: How do you determine the necessary sample size for an A/B test?
- Q2327: What is the benefit of A/B testing?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Hypothesis → Metric → Design → Run → Validate → Decide`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing an A/B test, I follow the Hypothesis → Metric → Design → Run → Validate → Decide framework.

**1️⃣ Hypothesis** → Clear statement: "If we change X for users Y, then outcome Z will change because R."

**2️⃣ Metrics** → Primary metric (decision metric), Guardrails (prevent harm like churn, errors), Diagnostics (explain why).

**3️⃣ Design** → Unit of randomization (user/session/geo), Population (who's eligible), Variants (Control vs Treatment), Duration (full cycles), Instrumentation (tracking).

**4️⃣ Run** → Gradual ramp (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%), monitor guardrails daily, freeze conflicting changes.

**5️⃣ Validate** → SRM check (sample ratio mismatch), Balance check (groups comparable), Attribution (exposure vs outcome), Logging (no changes).

**6️⃣ Decide** → Ship if primary metric improves and guardrails stable, Iterate if mixed results, Rollback if guardrails worsen.

**Key Principle:** Valid experiment = clear hypothesis + proper design + rigorous validation.
