# Executive Study Plan: P15D - Problem Solving & Learning
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, not per-question  
**Time:** 2-3 hours total across 3 passes  
**Source:** ~30 questions → 1 concept bucket → 1 high-impact bucket

**❤️ = "Hedgehog Answer"** - Your fallback narrative if you know nothing. Master these first!

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15D (PROBLEM SOLVING & LEARNING) QUESTIONS

**Even when "problem solving" or "learning" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Problem-Solving Keywords:
- "problem solving", "complex problem", "solve", "learn quickly", "learn something new"
- "broken process", "improve", "work outside comfort zone", "ambiguity", "unknown"

### Implicit P15D Indicators:
- **Problem-solving questions:** "Tell me about a complex problem you solved", "How do you approach problems?", "Time you improved a broken process"
- **Learning questions:** "Tell me about a time you learned something quickly", "How do you learn new technology?", "Work outside your comfort zone"
- **Complexity questions:** "How do you handle ambiguity?", "Complex technical problem", "Simple solution to complex problem"

### P15D vs P12 Distinction:
- **P15D (Problem Solving & Learning):** "Tell me about a complex problem you solved" → Focus: Past experience, STAR format
- **P12 (Operational Excellence):** "How do you ensure system reliability?" → Focus: Framework, process

### Red Flags (NOT P15D):
- "How do you ensure system reliability?" → P12 (Operational Excellence) - if framework-focused
- "How do you monitor a system?" → L5 (Observability) - if framework-focused

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Problem Solving & Learning Framework
**Questions:** ~30 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Tell me about a complex problem you solved" or "Time you learned something quickly" - problem-solving questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action (Problem-Solving Focus) → Result (STAR)
- **Situation:** Context (What was the problem? When? Where?), Challenge (What was the complexity? Complex technical problem, Ambiguous situation, Broken process, New technology to learn), What made it difficult?
- **Task:** Your responsibility (What was my responsibility?), Goal (What needed to be solved/learned? What was the goal?)
- **Action:** How I broke down the problem (Breaking into smaller parts, Identifying root cause, Prioritizing), Research and learning (How I learned - research, documentation, experts, practice), Experimentation (How I tested - prototypes, experiments, iterations), Iteration (How I refined - feedback, improvements, iterations), Why I did it this way (My reasoning, Alternatives considered)
- **Result:** Outcome (What happened? What was the result? Did I solve it?), Impact (What was the impact?), Learning (What did I learn? Focus on process and learning, not just outcome)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Complex problem: Situation (Problem X, complexity, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I approached - breakdown, research, experimentation, iteration), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"
- "Quick learning: Situation (New technology/task, urgency, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I learned - research, practice, iteration), Result (Outcome, application, learning)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1987: Tell me about a time when you solved a complex problem and how you went about it. (complex problem angle)
- Q2060: Tell me about a time you had to learn something quickly. (quick learning angle)
- Q902: Give me an example of a time when you had to work outside your comfort zone. How did you gain expertise in that area? (comfort zone angle)
- Q1922: Tell me about a time when you gave a simple solution to a complex problem. (simple solution angle)
- Q2069: Tell me about a time you improved a broken process or system. (process improvement angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Situation → Task → Action (Problem-Solving Focus) → Result (STAR)`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When answering problem-solving questions, I use Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR), but emphasize problem-solving process and learning.

**1️⃣ Situation** → What was the problem? When? Where?
  - **Challenge:** What was the complexity? (Complex technical problem, Ambiguous situation, Broken process, New technology to learn). What made it difficult?

**2️⃣ Task** → What was my responsibility? What needed to be solved/learned? What was the goal?

**3️⃣ Action** → I use 'I' statements, show thinking process:
  - **How I broke down the problem:** Breaking into smaller parts, Identifying root cause, Prioritizing
  - **Research and learning:** How I learned - research, documentation, experts, practice
  - **Experimentation:** How I tested - prototypes, experiments, iterations
  - **Iteration:** How I refined - feedback, improvements, iterations
  - **Why I did it this way:** My reasoning, Alternatives considered

**4️⃣ Result** → What happened? What was the result? Did I solve it? What was the impact? What did I learn? (Focus on process and learning, not just outcome).

**Key Principle:** Show thinking process, learning agility, and iteration.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1987 (Complex problem solved):** Focus on problem-solving
  - "Situation: Problem [specific complex problem], Context [when/where], Challenge [what made it complex - technical complexity, ambiguity, constraints, dependencies]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [solve the problem, achieve outcome], Constraints [time, resources, technical]"
  - "Action: How I approached [Breakdown: Broke problem into smaller parts, identified root cause, prioritized, Research: Researched solutions, consulted experts, reviewed documentation, Experimentation: Built prototypes, tested hypotheses, iterated, Iteration: Refined approach based on feedback, improved solution], Why [reasoning, alternatives considered]"
  - "Result: Outcome [problem solved, goal achieved], Impact [quantify - user impact, business impact, technical impact], Learning [what I learned, how I refined my approach, what I'd do differently]"
  - "Focus on showing my thinking process and problem-solving approach"

- **Q2060 (Learn something quickly):** Focus on learning
  - "Situation: New technology/task [specific thing to learn], Context [when/where], Challenge [urgency, complexity, limited time, needed to learn quickly]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [learn and apply quickly, achieve outcome], Constraints [time, resources, urgency]"
  - "Action: How I learned [Research: Researched - documentation, tutorials, examples, Practice: Practiced - hands-on, built prototypes, tested, Iteration: Refined - applied learning, got feedback, improved, Experts: Consulted experts, asked questions, got guidance], Why [reasoning, approach chosen]"
  - "Result: Outcome [learned and applied, goal achieved], Impact [quantify - how quickly learned, application success, value delivered], Learning [what I learned about learning, how I refined my approach]"
  - "Focus on showing learning agility and application"
