B2B / SaaS / Enterprise Design
│
├─ 1) User vs Buyer
│   ├─ Who is the user?

│   │   ├─ Administrators
│   │   └─ Decision makers
│   │
│   └─ Who is the buyer?
│       ├─ Procurement
│       ├─ IT/security
│       └─ Executives
│
├─ 2) Workflow Pain
│   ├─ Current workflow problems
│   │   ├─ Inefficiencies
│   │   ├─ Manual processes
│   │   └─ Integration gaps
│   │
│   └─ Pain prioritization
│       ├─ Frequency
│       ├─ Impact
│       └─ Cost
│
├─ 3) MVP
│   ├─ Minimum viable features
│   │   ├─ Core workflow automation
│   │   ├─ Critical integrations
│   │   └─ Security/compliance
│   │
│   └─ Phased rollout
│       ├─ Phase 1: Core features
│       └─ Phase 2+: Advanced features
│
├─ 4) Adoption Risks
│   ├─ User adoption barriers
│   │   ├─ Change resistance
│   │   ├─ Learning curve
│   │   └─ Workflow disruption
│   │
│   └─ Mitigation strategies
│       ├─ Training
│       ├─ Gradual rollout
│       └─ Support
│
└─ 5) Success Metrics
    ├─ Adoption metrics
    │   ├─ User activation
    │   ├─ Feature adoption
    │   └─ Seat utilization
    │
    └─ Business metrics
        ├─ Time saved
