# Executive Study Plan: P15A - Personal & Motivation
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, not per-question  
**Time:** 1-2 hours total across 2 passes  
**Source:** ~150 questions → 1 concept bucket → 1 high-impact bucket

**❤️ = "Hedgehog Answer"** - Your fallback narrative if you know nothing. Master these first!

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15A (PERSONAL & MOTIVATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "personal" or "motivation" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Personal Keywords:
- "tell me about yourself", "why did you become", "what are you passionate about"
- "what motivates you", "what are you looking for", "why this company/role"
- "career choice", "values", "culture fit", "excited about"

### Implicit P15A Indicators:
- **Personal questions:** "Tell me about yourself", "Why did you become a PM/Engineer?", "What are you passionate about?"
- **Motivation questions:** "What motivates you?", "What are you looking for in your next role?", "Why this company?"
- **Values questions:** "Which company values resonate with you?", "What matters to you?"

### P15A vs P16 Distinction:
- **P15A (Personal & Motivation):** "Tell me about yourself" → Focus: Who you are, what motivates you
- **P16 (Intent/Motivation):** "Why this company/role?" → Focus: Why this specific opportunity

### Red Flags (NOT P15A):
- "Tell me about a time when..." → P15B-P15F (Other behavioral categories)
- "Why this company?" → P16 (Intent/Motivation)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Personal & Motivation Framework
**Questions:** ~150 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (Important but lower priority than technical)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Tell me about yourself" or "What motivates you?" - personal and motivation questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR) OR Direct Answer
- **Understand Question:** What are they really asking? (Career choice: Why this path?, Values: What matters to you?, Culture fit: Do you align?, Motivation: What drives you?), Why they ask: Assess fit, motivation, authenticity
- **Provide Answer:** Be authentic (Share your real story, Be honest about motivations, Show genuine interest), Connect to role (How this relates to the role, Why you're a good fit, What you bring), Show growth (How you've evolved, What you're looking for next)
- **Demonstrate Fit:** Values alignment, Cultural fit, Long-term commitment

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Tell me about yourself: Career path (how I got here), Current focus (what I'm doing now), Why this role (what I'm looking for), What I bring (skills, experience, values)"
- "What motivates you: What drives me (impact, learning, growth), Why (personal values, experiences), How it relates to role (alignment with company/role)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q243: Describe your communication style when working with C-suite executives. (communication style angle)
- Q902: Give me an example of a time when you had to work outside your comfort zone. How did you gain expertise in that area? (comfort zone angle)
- Q154: Can you talk us through a product you've scoped and built? Include the goal and your specific role. (product case study angle)
- Q779: Explain a feature you've launched. (feature launch angle)
- Q1806: Share your experience around launching a product from 0 to 1. (0-to-1 launch angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR) OR Direct Answer`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When answering personal and motivation questions, I use STAR when appropriate, or provide a direct authentic answer.

**1️⃣ Understand the Question** → What are they really asking?
  - **Career choice:** Why this path?
  - **Values:** What matters to you?
  - **Culture fit:** Do you align?
  - **Motivation:** What drives you?

**Why they ask:** Assess fit, motivation, authenticity.

**2️⃣ Provide Your Answer** → 
  - **Be authentic:** Share your real story, Be honest about motivations, Show genuine interest
  - **Connect to role:** How this relates to the role, Why you're a good fit, What you bring
  - **Show growth:** How you've evolved, What you're looking for next

**3️⃣ Demonstrate Fit** → 
  - **Values alignment:** Your values align with company
  - **Cultural fit:** You fit the culture
  - **Long-term commitment:** You're committed long-term

**Key Principle:** Be authentic, show alignment, and demonstrate genuine interest.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **"Tell me about yourself":** Direct answer format
  - "Career path: How I got here (education, experience, journey), Current focus (what I'm doing now, what I'm passionate about), Why this role (what I'm looking for, why this opportunity), What I bring (skills, experience, values, what makes me unique)"
  - "Keep it concise (2-3 minutes), authentic, and relevant to the role"

- **"What motivates you?":** Direct answer format
  - "What drives me: Impact (making a difference), Learning (continuous growth), Growth (challenging myself), Why (personal values, experiences that shaped me), How it relates to role (alignment with company mission, role responsibilities, team culture)"
  - "Be specific, authentic, and show alignment with the role"
