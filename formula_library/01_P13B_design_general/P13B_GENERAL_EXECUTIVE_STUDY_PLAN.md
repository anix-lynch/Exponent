## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13B_GENERAL (DESIGN CONSUMER PLATFORMS - GENERAL) QUESTIONS

**Even when "consumer platform" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Consumer Platform Keywords:
- "design a", "design an", "design for", "consumer platform", "consumer app"
- "engagement", "retention", "user experience", "core loop"
- Generic consumer products that don't fit specific P13B subcategories

### Implicit P13B_GENERAL Indicators:
- **Consumer focus:** "Design a consumer app", "Design for users", "Design engagement platform"
- **Platform focus:** "Design a platform", "Design an app", "Design a product"
- **Engagement focus:** "Design to increase engagement", "Design for retention", "Design core loop"
- **General consumer:** Questions that don't fit P13B_SOCIAL, P13B_CONTENT, P13B_TRAVEL, P13B_MESSAGING, or P13B_ECOMMERCE

### P13B_GENERAL vs Other P13B Distinction:
- **P13B_GENERAL (General Consumer Platforms):** "Design a consumer app" → Focus: General consumer platform, engagement, retention
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Social, network effects
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption
- **P13B_TRAVEL (Travel/Transportation):** "Design a travel app" → Focus: Travel, navigation
- **P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication):** "Design a messaging app" → Focus: Real-time communication
- **P13B_ECOMMERCE (E-commerce/Shopping):** "Design a shopping app" → Focus: Commerce, purchase

### P13B_GENERAL vs P13A Distinction:
- **P13B_GENERAL (General Consumer Platforms):** "Design a consumer app" → Focus: Digital platform, engagement loop
- **P13A (Single-User Products):** "Design a better alarm clock" → Focus: Physical product, single user

### Red Flags (NOT P13B_GENERAL):
- "Design a social media app" → P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community)
- "Design a video streaming app" → P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media)
- "Design a better alarm clock" → P13A (Single-User Products)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Consumer Platform Design
**Questions:** ~80 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a consumer app" or "Design a platform" - core consumer platform framework
- **Framework:** Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics
- **Users:** Who are the users? (Primary users, Secondary users, User segments), What are their needs? (Functional needs, Emotional needs)
- **Jobs:** What jobs do users need done? (Core jobs, Related jobs, Emotional jobs), Job priority (Frequency, Importance)
- **Core Loop:** What is the engagement loop? (Entry point → Core action → Reward/feedback → Return trigger), How does it drive retention? (Daily usage, Habit formation)
- **Key Features:** Core features (Must-have for core loop, Differentiation), Supporting features (Onboarding, Discovery, Engagement mechanics)
- **Tradeoffs:** Features vs simplicity, Engagement vs privacy, Free vs paid
- **Success Metrics:** Engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, Time spent, Sessions per user), Retention metrics (Day 1/7/30 retention, Cohort retention curves)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design consumer app: Users (Primary, secondary, segments), Jobs (Core, related, emotional), Core Loop (Entry → Action → Reward → Return), Key Features (Core, supporting), Tradeoffs (Features vs simplicity, Engagement vs privacy), Success Metrics (DAU, time spent, retention)"
- "Design fitness app: Users (Fitness enthusiasts, beginners), Jobs (Track workouts, Get motivated, Learn), Core Loop (Open app → Log workout → Get feedback → Return), Key Features (Workout tracking, progress, social, challenges), Tradeoffs (Features vs simplicity, Social vs privacy), Success Metrics (DAU, workout frequency, retention)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q13: A newly launched mobile app has a 25% drop-off during sign-up. How would you investigate the issue? (Note: This is actually P3 Funnel, but appears in P13B_GENERAL CSV - use for sign-up flow design angle)
- Q793: Explain DoorDash's business model. (Note: This is actually P2 NSM, but appears in P13B_GENERAL CSV - use for platform business model angle)
- Q846: Explain why Airbnb is a good app. (Note: This is actually P2 NSM, but appears in P13B_GENERAL CSV - use for platform value angle)
- Generic consumer platform design questions from the CSV
- Generic consumer platform design questions from the CSV

**Note:** The P13B_GENERAL CSV contains many questions that are actually other patterns (P3 Funnel, P2 NSM). Focus on actual consumer platform design questions.

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing a consumer platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics.

**1️⃣ Users** → Who are the users? (Primary users, Secondary users, User segments), What are their needs? (Functional needs, Emotional needs).

**2️⃣ Jobs** → What jobs do users need done? (Core jobs, Related jobs, Emotional jobs), Prioritize by Frequency and Importance.

**3️⃣ Core Loop** → What is the engagement loop? (Entry point → Core action → Reward/feedback → Return trigger), How does it drive retention? (Daily usage, Habit formation).

**4️⃣ Key Features** → Core features (Must-have for core loop, Differentiation), Supporting features (Onboarding, Discovery, Engagement mechanics).

**5️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Features vs simplicity, Engagement vs privacy, Free vs paid.

**6️⃣ Success Metrics** → Engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, Time spent, Sessions per user), Retention metrics (Day 1/7/30 retention, Cohort retention curves).

**Key Principle:** Design a core loop that drives daily engagement and habit formation.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Generic consumer platform design:** Focus on general platform
  - "Users: Primary users, Secondary users, User segments"
  - "Needs: Functional needs, Emotional needs"
  - "Jobs: Core jobs (what users need done most), Related jobs (secondary needs), Emotional jobs (how users want to feel)"
  - "Core Loop: Entry point (how users enter), Core action (what they do), Reward/feedback (what they get), Return trigger (what brings them back)"
  - "Key Features: Core features (must-have for core loop), Supporting features (onboarding, discovery, engagement)"
  - "Tradeoffs: Features vs simplicity (balance), Engagement vs privacy (balance), Free vs paid (consider monetization)"
  - "Success Metrics: Engagement (DAU/MAU, time spent, sessions), Retention (Day 1/7/30 retention, cohort retention)"
  - "Prioritize the core loop that drives daily engagement"

### BUCKET 2: Engagement & Core Loop
**Questions:** ~40 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design to increase engagement" or "Design core loop" - same framework, with focus on engagement
- **Approach:** Same consumer platform framework, with focus on engagement loop and retention
- **Engagement Loop:** Entry point (How users enter), Core action (What they do), Reward/feedback (What they get), Return trigger (What brings them back)
- **Retention Drivers:** Daily usage (Habit formation, Notifications, Updates), Value creation (User value, Network effects, Content)
- **Success Metrics:** Engagement (DAU, time spent, sessions), Retention (Day 1/7/30, Cohort retention)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design engagement: Entry point (app open, notification), Core action (main action, engagement), Reward (value, feedback, social), Return trigger (notifications, updates, habit), Success metrics (DAU, time spent, retention)"
- "Increase engagement: Optimize core loop, Add engagement features, Leverage network effects, Measure engagement metrics"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Questions about increasing engagement, designing core loops, improving retention from the CSV
- Focus on actual consumer platform design questions, not mis-tagged questions

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop (Engagement Focus) → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When focusing on engagement and core loop, I use the same consumer platform framework but emphasize the engagement loop and retention.

**1️⃣ Users & Jobs** → Identify users and their jobs to understand what drives engagement.

**2️⃣ Core Loop (Engagement Focus)** → Entry point (How users enter - app open, notification, share), Core action (What they do - main action, engagement actions), Reward/feedback (What they get - value, feedback, social validation, progress), Return trigger (What brings them back - notifications, updates, habit, social pressure).

**3️⃣ Key Features (Engagement)** → Onboarding (Easy start, value demonstration), Discovery (Find content, features, value), Engagement mechanics (Gamification, social, progress), Notifications (Bring users back, relevant, timely).

**4️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Engagement vs privacy (balance), Features vs simplicity (keep simple), Free vs paid (consider monetization).

**5️⃣ Success Metrics** → Engagement (DAU, time spent, sessions per user), Retention (Day 1/7/30 retention, Cohort retention, Habit formation).

**Key Principle:** Design a core loop that creates daily habits and delivers value.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Generic engagement question:** Focus on engagement
  - "Understand Users and their Jobs to identify what drives engagement"
  - "Design Core Loop: Entry point (optimize for easy entry), Core action (make it valuable, easy, rewarding), Reward/feedback (immediate value, progress, social validation), Return trigger (notifications, updates, habit formation)"
  - "Design Key Features: Onboarding (show value quickly, make it easy), Discovery (help users find value), Engagement mechanics (gamification, social, progress tracking), Notifications (relevant, timely, valuable)"
  - "Measure Success Metrics: Engagement (DAU, time spent, sessions), Retention (Day 1/7/30 retention, habit formation)"
  - "Prioritize the core loop that delivers immediate value and creates habits"
