│   │   └─ Emotional jobs
│   │
│   └─ Job priority
│       ├─ Frequency
│       └─ Importance
│
├─ 3) Core Loop
│   ├─ What is the engagement loop?
│   │   ├─ Entry point
│   │   ├─ Core action
│   │   ├─ Reward
│   │   └─ Return trigger

│   │   └─ Core workflows
│   │
│   └─ Supporting features
│       ├─ Onboarding
│       ├─ Settings
│       └─ Help/support
│
├─ 5) Tradeoffs
│   ├─ Features vs simplicity
│   ├─ Speed vs quality
│   └─ Customization vs standardization
│
└─ 6) Success Metrics
    ├─ Engagement metrics
