## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY L7 (DATA MODELING) QUESTIONS

**Even when "data modeling" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Data Modeling Keywords:
- "data model", "data modeling", "schema", "data warehouse", "database design"
- "fact table", "dimension table", "star schema", "grain", "entities", "relationships"
- "design schema", "design data warehouse", "data structure"

### Implicit L7 Indicators:
- **Schema questions:** "Design a data warehouse schema for X", "How would you model data for X?"
- **Data structure questions:** "How should data be structured?", "What tables would you create?"
- **Entity questions:** "What entities exist?", "How do entities relate?"

### L7 vs L1 Distinction:
- **L7 (Data Modeling):** "Design a data warehouse schema" → Focus: How to structure data (Entities, relationships, grain)
- **L1 (Data Trust):** "Debug a metric that was off" → Focus: Is data trustworthy? (Source, freshness, completeness)

### L7 vs P12 Distinction:
- **L7 (Data Modeling):** "Design a data warehouse schema" → Focus: Data structure design
- **P12 (Operational Excellence):** "How do you ensure system reliability?" → Focus: Operational process

### Red Flags (NOT L7):
- "How do you debug a metric?" → L1 (Data Trust)
- "How do you ensure data quality?" → L1 (Data Trust)
- "How do you query data?" → L13 (SQL Reasoning)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Data Modeling Framework
**Questions:** ~8 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a data warehouse schema for X" or "How would you model data for X?" - core data modeling framework
- **Framework:** Entities → Relationships → Metrics → Grain → Validate
- **Entities:** Core nouns in the business (User, Order, Product, Session, Event), Rule: If it has its own lifecycle → entity
- **Relationships:** One-to-one (single relationship), One-to-many (parent-child), Many-to-many (requires junction table), Examples (User → Orders 1:N, Order ↔ Products M:N via Order_Items)
- **Metrics:** Counts (# orders, # sessions, # users), Sums (Revenue, Spend), Ratios (Conversion rate, Retention), Rule: Metrics live on facts, not dimensions
- **Grain:** What does one row represent? (One row per: Event, Session, Order, User-day), Rule: Never mix grains in one table, Grain is the most important decision
- **Validate:** Can we compute metrics without double-counting? Do joins stay clean? Does aggregation feel natural? Do edge cases break it?

**Concrete Examples:**
- "E-commerce data model: Entities (Users, Products, Orders, Sessions), Relationships (User → Orders 1:N, Order → Products M:N), Metrics (Revenue, Orders, Conversion), Grain (fact_orders: 1 row per order), Validate (Can compute daily revenue & user cohorts)"
- "Data modeling: Identify entities, define relationships, specify metrics, choose grain, validate model"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q279: Design a color propensity model for sponsored products ads at Amazon. (ML model/data modeling angle)
- Q289: Design a Data Warehouse Schema for a Ride-Sharing Service. (data warehouse design angle)
- Q290: Design a Data Warehouse Schema for Airbnb. (data warehouse design angle)
- Q291: Design a data warehouse schema for Amazon. (data warehouse design angle)
- Q292: Design a data warehouse schema for an e-commerce company. (data warehouse design angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Entities → Relationships → Metrics → Grain → Validate`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing a data model, I use Entities → Relationships → Metrics → Grain → Validate.

**1️⃣ Entities** → Core nouns in the business (User, Order, Product, Session, Event - things that exist in the business).

**Rule:** If it has its own lifecycle → entity (each entity represents a distinct business concept with its own attributes and lifecycle).

**2️⃣ Relationships** → 
  - **One-to-one:** Single relationship (e.g., User → Profile)
  - **One-to-many:** Parent-child (e.g., User → Orders, User → Sessions)
  - **Many-to-many:** Requires junction table (e.g., Order ↔ Products via Order_Items)

**Examples:** User → Orders 1:N, Order → Order_Items 1:N, Order_Items → Product M:N via Order_Items.

**Design relationships to support efficient queries and avoid data redundancy.**

**3️⃣ Metrics** → 
  - **Counts:** # orders, # sessions, # users, # events
  - **Sums:** Revenue, Spend, Total amount
  - **Ratios:** Conversion rate, Retention rate, Average order value

**Rule:** Metrics live on facts (fact tables), not dimensions. Facts store metrics; dimensions store context.

**4️⃣ Grain** → What does one row represent? One row per: Event, Session, Order, User-day, Transaction.

**Rule:** Never mix grains in one table. Grain is the most important decision - it determines what questions you can answer.

**Example:** fact_orders table = 1 row per order, fact_sessions table = 1 row per session.

**Model for questions, not for storage.**

**5️⃣ Validate** → 
  - Can we compute metrics without double-counting? (Check aggregation logic)
  - Do joins stay clean? (Verify relationships support efficient queries)
  - Does aggregation feel natural? (Can we easily roll up by time, user, product, etc.?)
  - Do edge cases break it? (Test with nulls, duplicates, orphaned records)

**Output:** Clean Fact + Dimension model. FACT tables: things that happen (events, orders, sessions). DIM tables: descriptions (users, products, time).

**Key Principle:** If joins feel painful, the model is wrong.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q289 (Ride-sharing data warehouse):** Focus on ride-sharing context
  - "Entities: Core nouns (User/rider, Driver, Trip, Vehicle, Payment - each has its own lifecycle)"
  - "Relationships: User → Trips 1:N (one user can have many trips), Driver → Trips 1:N (one driver can have many trips), Trip → Payment 1:1 (one trip has one payment), Trip → Vehicle 1:1 (one trip uses one vehicle)"
  - "Metrics: Counts (# trips, # users, # drivers), Sums (Revenue - sum of trip fares, Total distance), Ratios (Average trip distance, Conversion rate - completed trips / requested trips)"
  - "Grain: fact_trips (1 row per trip - trip_id, user_id, driver_id, vehicle_id, fare, distance, duration, timestamp), fact_events (1 row per event - event_id, trip_id, event_type - request, accept, start, complete, cancel, timestamp), dim_users (user attributes), dim_drivers (driver attributes), dim_vehicles (vehicle attributes), dim_time (time dimensions)"
  - "Validate: Can compute (daily trip count, Revenue by driver, User retention, Average trip distance), Joins (clean joins between fact_trips and dim tables), Aggregation (can roll up by time, user, driver, vehicle), Edge cases (handle cancelled trips, null values, duplicates)"
  - "Design: fact_trips (trip_id, user_id, driver_id, vehicle_id, fare, distance, duration, start_time, end_time), dim_users (user_id, signup_date, city, user_type), dim_drivers (driver_id, signup_date, city, vehicle_type), dim_vehicles (vehicle_id, make, model, year), dim_time (date, week, month, year)"

- **Q290 (Airbnb data warehouse):** Emphasize marketplace context
  - "Entities: Core nouns (User/guest/host, Listing, Booking, Review, Payment - each has its own lifecycle)"
  - "Relationships: User → Bookings 1:N (one user can have many bookings), User → Listings 1:N (one host can have many listings), Listing → Bookings 1:N (one listing can have many bookings), Booking → Review 1:1 (one booking has one review), Booking → Payment 1:1 (one booking has one payment)"
  - "Metrics: Counts (# bookings, # listings, # users), Sums (Revenue - sum of booking amounts, Total nights booked), Ratios (Occupancy rate, Average booking value, Conversion rate)"
  - "Grain: fact_bookings (1 row per booking - booking_id, guest_id, host_id, listing_id, check_in, check_out, nights, revenue, timestamp), fact_events (1 row per event - event_id, booking_id, event_type - search, view, book, cancel, timestamp), dim_users (user attributes), dim_listings (listing attributes), dim_time (time dimensions)"
  - "Validate: Can compute (daily bookings, Revenue by listing, Host performance, Guest retention), Joins (clean joins), Aggregation (can roll up by time, user, listing, city), Edge cases (handle cancelled bookings, null values)"
  - "Design: fact_bookings (booking_id, guest_id, host_id, listing_id, check_in, check_out, nights, revenue, booking_date), dim_users (user_id, signup_date, city, user_type), dim_listings (listing_id, host_id, city, property_type, price_per_night), dim_time (date, week, month, year)"

### BUCKET 2: Schema Design
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design schema for X" or "Data warehouse design" - same framework, with focus on schema structure
- **Approach:** Same data modeling framework, with focus on fact and dimension tables
- **Schema Structure:** FACT tables (things that happen: events, orders, sessions), DIM tables (descriptions: users, products, time)
- **Design Principles:** Grain consistency, Clean joins, Efficient aggregation, Avoid anti-patterns

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Star schema: fact_orders (order_id, user_id, product_id, revenue, timestamp), dim_users (user_id, country, signup_date), dim_products (product_id, category, price), dim_time (date, week, month)"
- "Schema design: Fact tables for metrics, dimension tables for context, clean relationships"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q289: Design a Data Warehouse Schema for a Ride-Sharing Service. (schema design angle)
- Q290: Design a Data Warehouse Schema for Airbnb. (schema design angle)
- Q291: Design a data warehouse schema for Amazon. (schema design angle)
- Q292: Design a data warehouse schema for an e-commerce company. (schema design angle)
- Q279: Design a color propensity model for sponsored products ads at Amazon. (ML model/schema angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `FACT Tables → DIM Tables → Design Principles`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing schemas, I use the same data modeling framework but focus on schema structure.

**1️⃣ FACT Tables** → Things that happen:
  - fact_events: event_id, user_id, ts, event_type
  - fact_orders: order_id, user_id, revenue, ts
  - fact_sessions: session_id, user_id, duration

**2️⃣ DIM Tables** → Descriptions:
  - dim_users: user_id, country, signup_date
  - dim_products: product_id, category, price
  - dim_time: date, week, month

**3️⃣ Design Principles** → 
  - **Grain consistency:** Never mix grains in one table
  - **Clean joins:** Relationships support efficient queries
  - **Efficient aggregation:** Can roll up by time, user, product easily
  - **Avoid anti-patterns:** No metric columns in dimension tables, No one table doing everything, No multiple grains mixed, No pre-aggregated numbers with no raw facts, No 'just denormalize everything' with no reason

**Key Principle:** Design for questions, not for storage.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q291 (Amazon data warehouse):** Focus on e-commerce schema
  - "FACT tables: fact_orders (order_id, user_id, order_date, revenue, items_count), fact_events (event_id, user_id, product_id, event_type - view, add_to_cart, purchase, timestamp), fact_sessions (session_id, user_id, start_time, end_time, page_views)"
  - "DIM tables: dim_users (user_id, signup_date, country, user_segment), dim_products (product_id, category, price, brand), dim_time (date, week, month, year), dim_categories (category_id, category_name, parent_category)"
  - "Design principles: Grain (fact_orders = 1 row per order, fact_events = 1 row per event), Clean joins (foreign keys to dim tables), Efficient aggregation (can roll up by time, user, product, category), Avoid anti-patterns (no metrics in dim tables, no mixed grains)"
  - "Design: fact_orders (order_id, user_id, order_date, revenue, items_count), fact_events (event_id, user_id, product_id, event_type, timestamp), dim_users (user_id, signup_date, country), dim_products (product_id, category, price), dim_time (date, week, month, year)"
