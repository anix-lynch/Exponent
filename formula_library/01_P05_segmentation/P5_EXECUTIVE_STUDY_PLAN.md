## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P5 (SEGMENTATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "segmentation" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Segmentation Keywords:
- "segment", "segmentation", "persona", "user groups", "customer segments"
- "which users", "who should we focus on", "target audience"

### Implicit P5 Indicators:
- **User focus questions:** "which users should we focus on?", "who is most valuable?", "different users behave differently"
- **Persona questions:** "create buyer personas", "understand customers", "core audiences"
- **Market questions:** "which market segment?", "which geography?", "target segment"
- **Behavior questions:** "segment by behavior", "engagement by segment", "churn by segment"
- **Design for segments:** "design for X segment", "tailor for Y users", "customize for Z"

### P5 vs P1 Distinction:
- **P5 (Segmentation):** "Which users should we focus on?" → Focus: DEFINE segments (Persona × Behavior × Value)
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Orders down 25%" → Focus: DIAGNOSE why metric dropped (segment to find hot spot)

### P5 vs P2 Distinction:
- **P5 (Segmentation):** "Which users matter most?" → Focus: DEFINE and RANK segments
- **P2 (NSM + KPI):** "What metrics for this product?" → Focus: DEFINE what to measure

### P5 vs P4 Distinction:
- **P5 (Segmentation):** "Segment users for churn analysis" → Focus: DEFINE segments to analyze
- **P4 (Cohort):** "Retention dropped 35%" → Focus: COMPARE cohorts over time

### Red Flags (NOT P5):
- "Orders down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)
- "Users drop at checkout" → P3 (Funnel)
- "Define success metrics" → P2 (NSM + KPI)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Classic User/Customer Segmentation
**Questions:** ~5 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Which users should we focus on?" or "How to segment customers?" - core segmentation framework
- **Framework:** (Persona × Behavior × Value) → Rank → Focus Top Segments
- **Persona (WHO):** Demographics (age, role, company size), Context (job-to-be-done, environment), Needs/constraints
- **Behavior (HOW):** Frequency (daily/weekly/occasional), Depth (light vs power usage), Lifecycle stage (new/active/mature)
- **Value (WHY):** Revenue (ARPU, LTV), Strategic value (growth, network effects), Cost/risk (support, churn risk)
- **Rank & Focus:** Impact on core metric, Size/growth potential, Effort to serve → Pick primary segment

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Segment e-commerce users: Persona (students, professionals, families) × Behavior (browsers, buyers, power shoppers) × Value (low/medium/high LTV) → Rank → Focus on power shoppers"
- "Create buyer personas: Define demographics, context, needs → Map behaviors → Assess value → Rank segments"
- "Segment for growth: Identify high-value segments (high LTV, low churn) → Focus product/features on them"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q153: Can you provide details on your strategies or methods for understanding customers or core audiences?
- Q1069: How do you create buyer personas?
- Q1559: How would you segment users for a new e-commerce platform?
- Q2147: Tell me how you'd segment customers to support a growth initiative.
- Q690: Design Whatsapp for either one of 3 segments: senior citizens, families, or businesses.

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Persona (WHO) × Behavior (HOW) × Value (WHY) → Rank → Focus`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When I need to segment users, I use the Persona × Behavior × Value framework.

**1️⃣ Define Personas (WHO)** → Demographics (age, role, company size), context (job-to-be-done, environment).

**2️⃣ Define Behaviors (HOW)** → Frequency of use (daily/weekly/occasional), depth of usage (light vs power users), lifecycle stage (new/active/mature).

**3️⃣ Assess Value (WHY)** → Revenue metrics (ARPU, LTV), strategic value (growth potential, network effects), cost/risk (support burden, churn risk).

**4️⃣ Combine into Segments** → Persona × Behavior × Value.

**5️⃣ Rank Segments** → By impact on core metric, size/growth potential, effort to serve.

**6️⃣ Focus** → Top segment as primary design target, secondary segment as nice-to-have, deprioritize the rest.

**Key Principle:** Segmentation = WHO they are × HOW they behave × WHY they matter.
