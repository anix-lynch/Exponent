## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Social Media Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Social media products are about **network effects** and **engagement loops**. Metrics must capture both user value (connection, content) and business value (ad revenue, growth).

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: creators + consumers
- Network effects: value increases with users
- Engagement loops: content → engagement → more content
- Monetization: ads, premium features, creator tools

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Social Media Products
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** DAU/MAU (growth), Time Spent (engagement), Weekly Engaged Users (balanced)
- **Key Insight:** Must balance creator value (content creation) + consumer value (content consumption)
- **Input KPIs:** Engagement (likes, comments, shares), Content Creation (posts, stories), Network Effects (connections, messages)
- **Leading Indicators:** First-week retention, Time to first engagement, Content upload rate
- **Guardrails:** User safety (reports, blocks), Content moderation, Creator burnout

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Instagram NSM: Weekly Engaged Users (users who post or engage weekly) - balances creation + consumption"
- "TikTok NSM: Daily Video Views per Active User - content consumption + engagement"
- "Facebook NSM: Daily Active Users - network effects + engagement"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Instagram/TikTok/Facebook
- What metrics would you track for a new social media feature?
- How would you measure success of Stories/Reels/Posts?
- What are the key metrics for a social platform?
- How would you define success for a creator platform?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Balance Creator + Consumer Value → NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For social media products, the NSM must balance creator value and consumer value.

**1️⃣ Define NSM** → Typically Weekly Engaged Users - users who either create content or engage with content weekly. Captures network effects and engagement loops.

**2️⃣ Input KPIs** → Engagement rate (likes, comments, shares per user), content creation rate (posts/stories per user), network effects (connections made, messages sent).

**3️⃣ Leading Indicators** → First-week retention, time to first engagement, content upload rate.

**4️⃣ Guardrails** → User safety (reports, blocks), content moderation effectiveness, creator satisfaction (prevent burnout).

**Key Principle:** Balance creator value (content creation) and consumer value (content consumption) - both sides must win.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for Instagram:** Focus on visual content
  - "NSM: Weekly Engaged Users who post or engage with visual content"
  - "Input KPIs: Stories/Posts created, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), Reels views"
  - "Leading indicators: first-post-creation rate, time-to-first-engagement"
  - "Guardrails: content safety, creator satisfaction, feed quality"

- **What metrics for new social feature:** Emphasize feature-specific
  - "Measure: adoption (weekly active users of feature) + engagement (feature usage per user)"
  - "Input KPIs: feature discovery rate, feature usage rate, engagement generated by feature"
  - "Leading indicators: first-feature-use rate, time-to-first-value"
  - "Guardrails: core platform metrics don't drop, user safety maintained"

- **Measure success of Stories/Reels:** Focus on content format
  - "NSM: Weekly Active Users who create or view Stories/Reels"
  - "Input KPIs: Stories/Reels created, views per Story/Reel, completion rate"
  - "Leading indicators: first-Story/Reel-creation rate, first-view rate"
  - "Guardrails: content quality, creator satisfaction, platform engagement maintained"

### BUCKET 2: Engagement & Content Metrics
**Questions:** ~12 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Engagement Metrics:** Likes, comments, shares, time spent, session frequency
- **Content Metrics:** Posts created, content quality, viral coefficient
- **Key Insight:** Engagement drives retention, content drives engagement
- **Measurement:** Engagement rate = (likes + comments + shares) / impressions
- **Quality Signals:** Completion rate, save rate, share rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Engagement rate: (likes + comments + shares) / impressions - measures content resonance"
- "Content creation rate: posts per active user - measures creator health"
- "Viral coefficient: shares per post - measures network effects strength"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How would you measure engagement on a social platform?
- What metrics indicate content quality?
- How do you measure network effects?
- What's the difference between reach and engagement?
- How would you improve content creation rates?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Measure Breadth + Depth → Engagement Rate → Content Quality → Network Effects`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For engagement metrics, I measure both breadth (how many users engage) and depth (how much they engage).

**1️⃣ Engagement Rate** → (likes + comments + shares) / impressions.

**2️⃣ Engagement Depth** → Time spent, session frequency, content creation rate.

**3️⃣ Content Quality** → Completion rate, save rate, share rate - these indicate content value.

**4️⃣ Network Effects** → Connections made, messages sent, group participation.

**Key Principle:** Balance creator metrics (content creation) with consumer metrics (engagement) to maintain a healthy ecosystem.

### BUCKET 3: Creator Platform Metrics
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Creator Metrics:** Creator retention, earnings, satisfaction, content quality
- **Key Insight:** Creators are the supply side - need to keep them happy
- **Measurement:** Creator LTV, content creation rate, creator satisfaction score
- **Guardrails:** Creator burnout, platform dependency, revenue share

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Creator retention: % of creators who post monthly - measures creator health"
- "Creator earnings: revenue per creator - measures monetization success"
- "Creator satisfaction: NPS or satisfaction score - prevents burnout"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How would you measure creator success?
- What metrics matter for a creator platform?
- How do you prevent creator burnout?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Creator Health → Retention + Earnings + Satisfaction → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For creator platforms, I measure creator health.

**1️⃣ Creator Health** → Retention (creators who post monthly), earnings (revenue per creator), satisfaction (NPS or satisfaction score).

**2️⃣ Input KPIs** → Content creation rate, content quality score, creator growth rate.

**3️⃣ Leading Indicators** → First-content-creation rate, time-to-first-earnings.

**4️⃣ Guardrails** → Creator burnout (decreasing creation rate), platform dependency (creators leaving), revenue share fairness.

**Key Principle:** Creators are successful → platform is successful. Keep creators happy.

**Questions:** ~5 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Growth Metrics:** DAU/MAU, new user acquisition, retention cohorts
- **Network Effects:** Connections made, messages sent, group participation
- **Key Insight:** Network effects create moat - measure connection density
- **Measurement:** Network density = connections / (users × users), viral coefficient

**Concrete Examples:**
- "DAU/MAU ratio: measures engagement frequency - higher = better"
- "Viral coefficient: new users per existing user - measures organic growth"
- "Network density: average connections per user - measures network strength"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure network effects?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `DAU/MAU → Viral Coefficient → Network Density → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For growth and network effects, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ DAU/MAU Ratio** → Engagement frequency - higher = better.

**2️⃣ Viral Coefficient** → New users per existing user - measures organic growth.

**3️⃣ Network Density** → Average connections per user - measures network strength.

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → New user acquisition, retention by cohort, connections made per user.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → User safety (prevent bad actors), content quality (maintain standards), platform health (prevent spam).

**Key Principle:** Strong network effects = high retention + high connection density + organic growth.
