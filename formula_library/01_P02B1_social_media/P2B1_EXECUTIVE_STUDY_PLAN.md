## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Social Media Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Social media products are about **network effects** and **engagement loops**. Metrics must capture both user value (connection, content) and business value (ad revenue, growth).

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: creators + consumers
- Network effects: value increases with users
- Engagement loops: content → engagement → more content
- Monetization: ads, premium features, creator tools

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Social Media Products
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** DAU/MAU (growth), Time Spent (engagement), Weekly Engaged Users (balanced)
- **Key Insight:** Must balance creator value (content creation) + consumer value (content consumption)
- **Input KPIs:** Engagement (likes, comments, shares), Content Creation (posts, stories), Network Effects (connections, messages)
- **Leading Indicators:** First-week retention, Time to first engagement, Content upload rate
- **Guardrails:** User safety (reports, blocks), Content moderation, Creator burnout

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Instagram NSM: Weekly Engaged Users (users who post or engage weekly) - balances creation + consumption"
- "TikTok NSM: Daily Video Views per Active User - content consumption + engagement"
- "Facebook NSM: Daily Active Users - network effects + engagement"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Instagram/TikTok/Facebook
- What metrics would you track for a new social media feature?
- How would you measure success of Stories/Reels/Posts?
- What are the key metrics for a social platform?
- How would you define success for a creator platform?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For social media products, the NSM must balance creator value and consumer value. I typically use Weekly Engaged Users - users who either create content or engage with content weekly. This captures network effects and engagement loops. Input KPIs: engagement rate (likes, comments, shares per user), content creation rate (posts/stories per user), and network effects (connections made, messages sent). Leading indicators: first-week retention, time to first engagement, content upload rate. Guardrails: user safety (reports, blocks), content moderation effectiveness, and creator satisfaction to prevent burnout."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for Instagram:** Focus on visual content → "For Instagram, NSM: Weekly Engaged Users who post or engage with visual content. Input KPIs: Stories/Posts created, engagement rate (likes, comments, shares), Reels views. Leading indicators: first-post-creation rate, time-to-first-engagement. Guardrails: content safety, creator satisfaction, feed quality."

- **What metrics for new social feature:** Emphasize feature-specific → "For a new social feature, I'd measure adoption (weekly active users of feature) and engagement (feature usage per user). Input KPIs: feature discovery rate, feature usage rate, engagement generated by feature. Leading indicators: first-feature-use rate, time-to-first-value. Guardrails: core platform metrics don't drop, user safety maintained."

- **Measure success of Stories/Reels:** Focus on content format → "For Stories/Reels, NSM: Weekly Active Users who create or view Stories/Reels. Input KPIs: Stories/Reels created, views per Story/Reel, completion rate. Leading indicators: first-Story/Reel-creation rate, first-view rate. Guardrails: content quality, creator satisfaction, platform engagement maintained."

### BUCKET 2: Engagement & Content Metrics
**Questions:** ~12 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Engagement Metrics:** Likes, comments, shares, time spent, session frequency
- **Content Metrics:** Posts created, content quality, viral coefficient
- **Key Insight:** Engagement drives retention, content drives engagement
- **Measurement:** Engagement rate = (likes + comments + shares) / impressions
- **Quality Signals:** Completion rate, save rate, share rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Engagement rate: (likes + comments + shares) / impressions - measures content resonance"
- "Content creation rate: posts per active user - measures creator health"
- "Viral coefficient: shares per post - measures network effects strength"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How would you measure engagement on a social platform?
- What metrics indicate content quality?
- How do you measure network effects?
- What's the difference between reach and engagement?
- How would you improve content creation rates?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For engagement metrics, I measure both breadth (how many users engage) and depth (how much they engage). Engagement rate = (likes + comments + shares) / impressions. I also track time spent, session frequency, and content creation rate. For content quality, I use completion rate, save rate, and share rate - these indicate content value. Network effects are measured by connections made, messages sent, and group participation. The key is balancing creator metrics (content creation) with consumer metrics (engagement) to maintain a healthy ecosystem."

### BUCKET 3: Creator Platform Metrics
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Creator Metrics:** Creator retention, earnings, satisfaction, content quality
- **Key Insight:** Creators are the supply side - need to keep them happy
- **Measurement:** Creator LTV, content creation rate, creator satisfaction score
- **Guardrails:** Creator burnout, platform dependency, revenue share

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Creator retention: % of creators who post monthly - measures creator health"
- "Creator earnings: revenue per creator - measures monetization success"
- "Creator satisfaction: NPS or satisfaction score - prevents burnout"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How would you measure creator success?
- What metrics matter for a creator platform?
- How do you prevent creator burnout?
- What's the relationship between creator metrics and platform metrics?
- How would you improve creator retention?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For creator platforms, I measure creator health: retention (creators who post monthly), earnings (revenue per creator), and satisfaction (NPS or satisfaction score). Input KPIs: content creation rate, content quality score, creator growth rate. Leading indicators: first-content-creation rate, time-to-first-earnings. Guardrails: creator burnout (decreasing creation rate), platform dependency (creators leaving), and revenue share fairness. The key is ensuring creators are successful, which drives platform success."

### BUCKET 4: Growth & Network Effects
**Questions:** ~5 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Growth Metrics:** DAU/MAU, new user acquisition, retention cohorts
- **Network Effects:** Connections made, messages sent, group participation
- **Key Insight:** Network effects create moat - measure connection density
- **Measurement:** Network density = connections / (users × users), viral coefficient

**Concrete Examples:**
- "DAU/MAU ratio: measures engagement frequency - higher = better"
- "Viral coefficient: new users per existing user - measures organic growth"
- "Network density: average connections per user - measures network strength"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure network effects?
- What metrics indicate strong network effects?
- How would you improve DAU/MAU ratio?
- What's the relationship between growth and engagement?
- How do you measure viral growth?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For growth and network effects, I measure DAU/MAU ratio (engagement frequency), viral coefficient (new users per existing user), and network density (average connections per user). Input KPIs: new user acquisition, retention by cohort, connections made per user. Leading indicators: first-connection rate, time-to-first-message, group participation rate. Guardrails: user safety (prevent bad actors), content quality (maintain standards), and platform health (prevent spam). Strong network effects show in high retention, high connection density, and organic growth."
