## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why On-Demand Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** On-demand products are about **matching supply and demand in real-time**. Metrics must capture both sides (supply = drivers/workers, demand = users) and the efficiency of matching them.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: supply (drivers/workers) + demand (users)
- Real-time matching: need speed and efficiency
- Utilization: supply must be utilized to be profitable
- Geography-dependent: local markets matter

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for On-Demand Products
**Questions:** ~5 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** Time to Match (speed), Completed Rides/Deliveries (volume), Supply/Demand Balance (health)
- **Key Insight:** Must balance speed (user experience) + utilization (supply efficiency) + volume (business scale)
- **Input KPIs:** Supply (active drivers, utilization), Demand (request volume, peak coverage), Matching (match rate, ETA accuracy)
- **Leading Indicators:** Driver sign-up rate, Request acceptance rate, Peak hour availability
- **Guardrails:** Driver satisfaction, User safety, Cost per transaction

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Uber NSM: Completed Rides per Week - balances user value (mobility) + business value (revenue)"
- "DoorDash NSM: Successful Deliveries per Week - measures marketplace health"
- "Instacart NSM: Completed Orders per Week - captures both sides of marketplace"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Uber/Lyft/DoorDash
- What metrics would you track for an on-demand service?
- How would you measure success in a new city?
- What are the key metrics for ride-sharing?
- How would you define success for a delivery platform?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For on-demand products, the NSM is typically Completed Rides/Deliveries per Week - it captures user value (mobility/delivery) and business value (revenue). Input KPIs: supply side (active drivers online, driver utilization, driver earnings), demand side (request volume, peak hour coverage, user wait time), and matching efficiency (match rate, ETA accuracy, cancellation rate). Leading indicators: driver sign-up rate, request acceptance rate, peak hour availability. Guardrails: driver satisfaction (prevents churn), user safety (trust), and cost per transaction (profitability)."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for Uber:** Focus on ride-sharing → "For Uber, NSM: Completed Rides per Week. Input KPIs: supply (active drivers, driver utilization), demand (ride requests, peak coverage), matching (time-to-match, ETA accuracy). Leading indicators: driver sign-up rate, ride acceptance rate. Guardrails: driver earnings, rider safety, cost per ride."

- **Measure success in new city:** Emphasize market launch → "For new city, NSM: Completed Rides per Week. Key metrics: supply/demand balance (ratio of drivers to requests), time-to-match (speed), match rate (efficiency). Leading indicators: driver onboarding rate, first-ride-request rate. Guardrails: driver earnings (must be attractive), rider satisfaction, market penetration."

### BUCKET 2: Supply/Demand Balance Metrics
**Questions:** ~4 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Supply Metrics:** Active drivers online, driver utilization, driver earnings, driver retention
- **Demand Metrics:** Request volume, peak hour coverage, user wait time, request acceptance rate
- **Key Insight:** Balance is critical - too much supply = low utilization, too little = long wait times
- **Measurement:** Supply/demand ratio, utilization rate, wait time, match rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Supply/demand ratio: active drivers / ride requests - optimal around 1.2-1.5"
- "Driver utilization: % of time drivers are on trips - target 60-70%"
- "Wait time: time from request to match - target < 5 minutes"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure supply/demand balance?
- What metrics indicate healthy marketplace?
- How would you improve driver utilization?
- What's the relationship between supply and wait time?
- How do you prevent driver churn?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For supply/demand balance, I measure the ratio of active drivers to ride requests (optimal 1.2-1.5), driver utilization (% of time on trips, target 60-70%), and wait time (time to match, target < 5 min). Input KPIs: supply (active drivers, driver sign-ups, driver retention), demand (request volume, peak coverage, user retention). Leading indicators: driver sign-up rate, request acceptance rate, peak hour availability. Guardrails: driver earnings (must be attractive), user wait time (must be acceptable), cost per transaction (must be profitable)."

### BUCKET 3: Matching Efficiency Metrics
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Efficiency Metrics:** Time to match, ETA accuracy, match rate, cancellation rate
- **Key Insight:** Fast, accurate matching = better user experience + higher utilization
- **Measurement:** Time to match (target < 2 min), ETA accuracy (target ± 2 min), match rate (target > 95%)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Time to match: request to driver acceptance - measures speed"
- "ETA accuracy: predicted vs actual arrival - measures reliability"
- "Match rate: % of requests successfully matched - measures efficiency"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure matching efficiency?
- What metrics indicate good matching?
- How would you improve ETA accuracy?
- What's the relationship between matching and utilization?
- How do you reduce cancellation rate?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For matching efficiency, I measure time to match (request to acceptance, target < 2 min), ETA accuracy (predicted vs actual, target ± 2 min), and match rate (% successfully matched, target > 95%). Input KPIs: algorithm quality, driver availability, request patterns. Leading indicators: first-match time, acceptance rate, cancellation rate. Guardrails: user wait time (must be acceptable), driver earnings (must be fair), platform reliability (must be consistent)."

### BUCKET 4: Geographic Expansion Metrics
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Expansion Metrics:** Market penetration, supply/demand balance by city, city-level profitability
- **Key Insight:** Each city is a separate market - need city-level metrics
- **Measurement:** Rides per capita, market share, time to profitability

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Market penetration: rides per capita - measures adoption"
- "Time to profitability: months to break even - measures efficiency"
- "City-level NSM: completed rides per week per city"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure success in a new city?
- What metrics matter for geographic expansion?
- How do you prioritize which cities to enter?
- What's the relationship between city size and metrics?
- How do you measure market penetration?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For geographic expansion, I measure city-level NSM (completed rides per week), market penetration (rides per capita), and time to profitability (months to break even). Input KPIs: supply growth (driver sign-ups), demand growth (user sign-ups), matching efficiency (time to match). Leading indicators: first-ride rate, driver activation rate, user retention. Guardrails: driver earnings (must be attractive), user satisfaction (must be high), unit economics (must be profitable)."

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2B2 (ON-DEMAND METRICS) QUESTIONS

**Look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Keywords:
- "Uber", "Lyft", "DoorDash", "Instacart", "on-demand", "ride-sharing", "delivery"
- "time to match", "driver utilization", "delivery time", "ETA", "supply/demand"

### Implicit Indicators:
- **Matching questions:** "how to measure matching?", "time to match", "driver availability"
- **Supply/demand:** "supply and demand balance", "driver utilization", "rider wait time"
- **Geographic:** "new city launch", "market expansion", "city-level metrics"
- **Efficiency:** "matching efficiency", "ETA accuracy", "cancellation rate"

### P2B2 vs Other Patterns:
- **P2B2 (On-Demand):** "What metrics for Uber in new city?" → Focus: Supply/demand, matching, utilization
- **P2 (General NSM):** "What metrics for product?" → Focus: Universal NSM framework
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Rides down 25%" → Focus: Diagnose why metric dropped
