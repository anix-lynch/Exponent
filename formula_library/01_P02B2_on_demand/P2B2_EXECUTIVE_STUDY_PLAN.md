## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why On-Demand Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** On-demand products are about **matching supply and demand in real-time**. Metrics must capture both sides (supply = drivers/workers, demand = users) and the efficiency of matching them.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: supply (drivers/workers) + demand (users)
- Real-time matching: need speed and efficiency
- Utilization: supply must be utilized to be profitable
- Geography-dependent: local markets matter

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for On-Demand Products
**Questions:** ~5 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** Time to Match (speed), Completed Rides/Deliveries (volume), Supply/Demand Balance (health)
- **Key Insight:** Must balance speed (user experience) + utilization (supply efficiency) + volume (business scale)
- **Input KPIs:** Supply (active drivers, utilization), Demand (request volume, peak coverage), Matching (match rate, ETA accuracy)
- **Leading Indicators:** Driver sign-up rate, Request acceptance rate, Peak hour availability
- **Guardrails:** Driver satisfaction, User safety, Cost per transaction

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Uber NSM: Completed Rides per Week - balances user value (mobility) + business value (revenue)"
- "DoorDash NSM: Successful Deliveries per Week - measures marketplace health"
- "Instacart NSM: Completed Orders per Week - captures both sides of marketplace"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Uber/Lyft/DoorDash
- What metrics would you track for an on-demand service?
- How would you measure success in a new city?
- What are the key metrics for ride-sharing?
- How would you define success for a delivery platform?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `NSM → Supply KPIs → Demand KPIs → Matching Efficiency → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For on-demand products, the NSM is typically Completed Rides/Deliveries per Week.

**1️⃣ NSM** → Captures user value (mobility/delivery) and business value (revenue).

**2️⃣ Supply KPIs** → Active drivers online, driver utilization, driver earnings.

**3️⃣ Demand KPIs** → Request volume, peak hour coverage, user wait time.

**4️⃣ Matching Efficiency** → Match rate, ETA accuracy, cancellation rate.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Driver satisfaction (prevents churn), user safety (trust), cost per transaction (profitability).

**Key Principle:** Balance speed (user experience) + utilization (supply efficiency) + volume (business scale).

### BUCKET 2: Supply/Demand Balance Metrics
**Questions:** ~4 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Supply Metrics:** Active drivers online, driver utilization, driver earnings, driver retention
- **Demand Metrics:** Request volume, peak hour coverage, user wait time, request acceptance rate
- **Key Insight:** Balance is critical - too much supply = low utilization, too little = long wait times
- **Measurement:** Supply/demand ratio, utilization rate, wait time, match rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Supply/demand ratio: active drivers / ride requests - optimal around 1.2-1.5"
- "Driver utilization: % of time drivers are on trips - target 60-70%"
- "Wait time: time from request to match - target < 5 minutes"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure supply/demand balance?
- What metrics indicate healthy marketplace?
- How would you improve driver utilization?
- What's the relationship between supply and wait time?
- How do you prevent driver churn?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Supply/Demand Ratio → Utilization → Wait Time → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For supply/demand balance, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ Supply/Demand Ratio** → Active drivers / ride requests (optimal 1.2-1.5).

**2️⃣ Driver Utilization** → % of time on trips (target 60-70%).

**3️⃣ Wait Time** → Time to match (target < 5 min).

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Supply (active drivers, sign-ups, retention), demand (request volume, peak coverage, user retention).

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Driver earnings (must be attractive), user wait time (must be acceptable), cost per transaction (must be profitable).

**Key Principle:** Balance is critical - too much supply = low utilization, too little = long wait times.

### BUCKET 3: Matching Efficiency Metrics
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Efficiency Metrics:** Time to match, ETA accuracy, match rate, cancellation rate
- **Key Insight:** Fast, accurate matching = better user experience + higher utilization
- **Measurement:** Time to match (target < 2 min), ETA accuracy (target ± 2 min), match rate (target > 95%)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Time to match: request to driver acceptance - measures speed"
- "ETA accuracy: predicted vs actual arrival - measures reliability"
- "Match rate: % of requests successfully matched - measures efficiency"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure matching efficiency?
- What metrics indicate good matching?
- How would you improve ETA accuracy?
- What's the relationship between matching and utilization?
- How do you reduce cancellation rate?
