# Executive Study Plan: P15B - Execution & Ownership
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, not per-question  
**Time:** 2-3 hours total across 3 passes  
**Source:** ~20 questions → 1 concept bucket → 1 high-impact bucket

**❤️ = "Hedgehog Answer"** - Your fallback narrative if you know nothing. Master these first!

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15B (EXECUTION & OWNERSHIP) QUESTIONS

**Even when "execution" or "ownership" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Execution Keywords:
- "execution", "ownership", "delivery", "deadline", "project failure", "missed deadline"
- "off track", "behind schedule", "resource constraints", "pressure", "recovery"

### Implicit P15B Indicators:
- **Execution questions:** "Tell me about a time you missed a deadline", "Project that went off track", "How do you handle pressure?"
- **Ownership questions:** "Tell me about taking ownership", "Project you weren't responsible for", "How do you handle failure?"
- **Delivery questions:** "How do you deliver under constraints?", "Project recovery", "Resource management"

### P15B vs P12 Distinction:
- **P15B (Execution & Ownership):** "Tell me about a time you missed a deadline" → Focus: Past experience, STAR format
- **P12 (Operational Excellence):** "How do you ensure system reliability?" → Focus: Framework, process

### Red Flags (NOT P15B):
- "How do you ensure system reliability?" → P12 (Operational Excellence)
- "How do you manage projects?" → P12 (Operational Excellence) - if framework-focused

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Execution & Ownership Framework
**Questions:** ~20 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Tell me about a time you missed a deadline" or "Project that went off track" - execution and ownership questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR)
- **Situation:** Context (What was the situation? When? Where?), Challenge (Deadline pressure, Resource constraints, Project failure, Unexpected challenges), What made it difficult?
- **Task:** Your responsibility (What was I accountable for?), Goal (What needed to be achieved?), Constraints (Time, resources, dependencies)
- **Action:** How I handled pressure (Prioritization, Communication, Problem-solving), How I recovered from failure (Ownership, Root cause analysis, Recovery plan), How I took ownership (Taking responsibility, Not blaming others, Leading the fix), How I delivered under constraints (Scope cuts, Resource reallocation, Timeline adjustments, Tradeoffs), Why I did it this way (My reasoning, Tradeoffs considered)
- **Result:** Outcome (What happened? What was the result? Did I achieve the goal?), Impact (What was the impact?), Learning (What did I learn? What would I do differently?)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Missed deadline: Situation (Project X, deadline pressure, constraints), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I handled it, ownership, recovery), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"
- "Project failure: Situation (Project X, failure, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I handled failure, ownership, recovery), Result (Outcome, learning, improvements)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1971: Tell me about a time when you missed a deadline. (deadline miss angle)
- Q222: Describe a time when your project failed. (project failure angle)
- Q1625: If you join a project that is 25% complete and has used 85% of resources, what would be your next steps? (project recovery angle)
- Q1004: Have you ever faced a project deadline that was earlier than expected? How did you handle it and what was the outcome? (deadline pressure angle)
- Q1995: Tell me about a time when you took ownership of a project you weren't originally responsible for. (ownership angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Situation → Task → Action (Execution/Ownership Focus) → Result (STAR)`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When answering execution and ownership questions, I use Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR), but emphasize execution and ownership.

**1️⃣ Situation** → What was the situation? When? Where?
  - **Challenge:** Deadline pressure, Resource constraints, Project failure, Unexpected challenges
  - **What made it difficult?**

**2️⃣ Task** → What was my responsibility? What was I accountable for? What needed to be achieved? What constraints existed?

**3️⃣ Action** → I use 'I' statements, focus on my actions:
  - **How I handled pressure:** Prioritization, Communication, Problem-solving
  - **How I recovered from failure:** Ownership, Root cause analysis, Recovery plan
  - **How I took ownership:** Taking responsibility, Not blaming others, Leading the fix
  - **How I delivered under constraints:** Scope cuts, Resource reallocation, Timeline adjustments, Tradeoffs
  - **Why I did it this way:** My reasoning, Tradeoffs considered

**4️⃣ Result** → What happened? What was the result? Did I achieve the goal? What was the impact? What did I learn? (Focus on learning and improvement, not just success).

**Key Principle:** Show ownership, problem-solving, and judgment under pressure.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1971 (Missed deadline):** Focus on deadline miss
  - "Situation: Project [specific project], Deadline [original deadline], Context [when/where], Challenge [what made it difficult - scope creep, resource constraints, unexpected issues, dependencies]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [deliver project, meet deadline], Constraints [time, resources, dependencies]"
  - "Action: How I handled it [immediate actions - assess situation, communicate to stakeholders, prioritize, Problem-solving - identify root cause, find solutions, Ownership - took responsibility, didn't blame others, led the fix, Recovery - adjusted timeline, scope cuts, resource reallocation, tradeoffs], Why [reasoning, alternatives considered]"
  - "Result: Outcome [what happened - did we recover? New deadline?], Impact [quantify - delay impact, stakeholder impact, team impact], Learning [what I learned, what I'd do differently - better planning, earlier communication, risk management]"
  - "Focus on ownership, problem-solving, and learning, not excuses"

- **Q1625 (Project 25% complete, 85% resources used):** Emphasize project recovery
  - "Situation: Project [specific project], Status (25% complete, Resources 85% used), Context [when/where], Challenge [project is behind, resources almost gone, high risk of failure]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [recover project, deliver value, minimize impact], Constraints [limited resources, time pressure, stakeholder expectations]"
  - "Action: How I approached it [immediate assessment - understand current state, root cause analysis, Stakeholder communication - transparent communication, reset expectations, Problem-solving - identify options, prioritize, make tradeoffs, Ownership - took responsibility, led recovery, Recovery plan - scope cuts, resource reallocation, timeline adjustments, risk mitigation], Why [reasoning, alternatives considered, tradeoffs]"
  - "Result: Outcome [what happened - did we recover? Deliver value?], Impact [quantify - what was delivered, stakeholder satisfaction, team impact], Learning [what I learned, what I'd do differently - better estimation, earlier intervention, risk management]"
  - "Focus on ownership, problem-solving, and realistic recovery"
