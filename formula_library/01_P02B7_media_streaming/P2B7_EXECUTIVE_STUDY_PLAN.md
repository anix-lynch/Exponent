## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Media/Streaming Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Media/Streaming products are about **content consumption and retention**. Metrics must capture both content quality (what users watch) and engagement depth (how much they watch) to drive retention.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Content-driven: quality content drives engagement
- Retention-focused: watch time predicts retention
- Creator/content balance: need both creators and consumers
- Discovery critical: users must find content they love

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Media/Streaming Products
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** Watch Time, Retention (D7, D30), Weekly Engaged Viewers
- **Key Insight:** Watch time is usually the NSM - it predicts retention and engagement
- **Input KPIs:** Consumption (watch time per user, completion rate, sessions), Content Quality (creator satisfaction, content diversity, upload rate), Discovery (search success, recommendation CTR, discovery time)
- **Leading Indicators:** First-week watch time, Content completion rate, Creator upload frequency
- **Guardrails:** Content quality standards, Creator burnout, User satisfaction (NPS)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Netflix NSM: Weekly Watch Time per Active User - measures engagement + retention"
- "YouTube NSM: Watch Time - total hours watched, measures content consumption"
- "Spotify NSM: Weekly Engaged Listeners - users who listen weekly"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Netflix/YouTube/Spotify
- What metrics would you track for a streaming service?
- How would you measure streaming success?
- What are the key metrics for media platforms?
- How would you define success for a content platform?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For media/streaming products, the NSM is typically Watch Time - total hours watched per user. This captures both engagement and retention. Input KPIs: consumption (watch time per user, completion rate, sessions per user), content quality (creator satisfaction, content diversity, upload rate), and discovery (search success rate, recommendation click-through, content discovery time). Leading indicators: first-week watch time, content completion rate, creator upload frequency. Guardrails: content quality standards (must be high), creator burnout (must prevent), and user satisfaction (must be positive). Watch time predicts retention - users who watch more stay longer."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for Netflix:** Focus on video streaming → "For Netflix, NSM: Weekly Watch Time per Active User. Input KPIs: watch time, completion rate, content discovery. Leading indicators: first-week watch time, content completion rate. Guardrails: content quality, user satisfaction, recommendation quality."

- **Measure streaming success:** Emphasize engagement → "Streaming success is measured by watch time (total hours watched) and retention (D7, D30). Input KPIs: consumption depth, content quality, discovery efficiency. Leading indicators: first-week engagement, content completion. Guardrails: content quality, creator satisfaction, user experience."

### BUCKET 2: Content Consumption & Engagement Metrics
**Questions:** ~1 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Consumption Metrics:** Watch time per user, completion rate, sessions per user, binge rate
- **Engagement Metrics:** Content completion, likes/shares, playlist creation, repeat views
- **Key Insight:** Depth of consumption (completion rate) predicts retention better than breadth
- **Measurement:** Average watch time, completion rate by content type, sessions per week

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Watch time: total hours watched per user - measures engagement depth"
- "Completion rate: % of content completed - measures content quality"
- "Sessions per user: frequency of engagement - measures habit formation"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure content consumption?
- What metrics indicate content engagement?
- How would you improve watch time?
- What's the relationship between consumption and retention?
- How do you measure content quality?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For content consumption and engagement, I measure watch time (total hours watched per user), completion rate (% of content completed), and sessions per user (frequency of engagement). Input KPIs: average watch time, completion rate by content type, binge rate (multiple episodes in session). Leading indicators: first-week watch time, content completion rate, repeat view rate. Guardrails: content quality (must be high), user satisfaction (must be positive), recommendation quality (must be relevant). Depth of consumption (completion rate) predicts retention better than breadth - users who complete content stay longer."

### BUCKET 3: Content Discovery & Recommendation Metrics
**Questions:** ~1 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Discovery Metrics:** Search success rate, recommendation CTR, time to find content, discovery diversity
- **Recommendation Metrics:** Recommendation accuracy, click-through rate, watch time from recommendations
- **Key Insight:** Good discovery = faster time to value = better retention
- **Measurement:** Search-to-watch conversion, recommendation CTR, discovery time

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Search success rate: % of searches that result in watch - measures discovery efficiency"
- "Recommendation CTR: clicks on recommendations - measures recommendation quality"
- "Discovery time: time to find content - measures UX quality"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure content discovery?
- What metrics indicate good recommendations?
- How would you improve recommendation accuracy?
- What's the relationship between discovery and engagement?
- How do you measure search success?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For content discovery and recommendations, I measure search success rate (% of searches that result in watch), recommendation CTR (clicks on recommendations), and discovery time (time to find content). Input KPIs: search-to-watch conversion, recommendation accuracy, discovery diversity. Leading indicators: first-content-find rate, recommendation engagement rate, search usage rate. Guardrails: content diversity (must show variety), recommendation quality (must be relevant), user satisfaction (must be positive). Good discovery = faster time to value = better retention - users who find content quickly stay longer."

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2B7 (MEDIA/STREAMING METRICS) QUESTIONS

**Look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Keywords:
- "Netflix", "YouTube", "Spotify", "streaming", "watch time", "content", "creator"
- "media platform", "video platform", "audio platform", "content consumption"

### Implicit Indicators:
- **Consumption questions:** "watch time", "listen time", "content consumption", "completion rate"
- **Content questions:** "content quality", "creator satisfaction", "upload rate", "content discovery"
- **Retention questions:** "viewer retention", "listener retention", "content engagement"
- **Discovery questions:** "recommendations", "search success", "content discovery", "personalization"

### P2B7 vs Other Patterns:
- **P2B7 (Media/Streaming):** "What metrics for Netflix?" → Focus: Watch time, retention, content
- **P2 (General NSM):** "What metrics for product?" → Focus: Universal NSM framework
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Watch time down 25%" → Focus: Diagnose why metric dropped
