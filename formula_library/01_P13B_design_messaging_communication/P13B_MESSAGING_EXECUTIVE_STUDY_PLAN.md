**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a messaging app" or "Design chat feature" - core messaging platform framework
- **Framework:** Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics
- **Users:** Who are the users? (Individual users, Groups/teams, Businesses), What are their needs? (Real-time communication, Reliability, Privacy)
- **Jobs:** What jobs do users need done? (Send messages, Receive messages, Organize conversations, Share media/files), Job priority (Urgency, Frequency)
- **Core Loop:** What is the engagement loop? (Receive message → Read/respond → Send message → Wait for response), How does it drive retention? (Daily communication, Network effects)
- **Key Features:** Core features (Messaging, Notifications, Media sharing, File sharing), Supporting features (Search, Organization, Privacy, Group features)
- **Tradeoffs:** Real-time vs reliability, Privacy vs features, Simplicity vs functionality
- **Success Metrics:** Communication metrics (Messages sent/received, Response time, Delivery rate), Retention metrics (Daily active users, Network growth, Engagement)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design messaging app: Users (Individual users, groups, businesses), Jobs (Send, receive, organize, share), Core Loop (Receive → Read → Respond → Wait), Key Features (Messaging, notifications, media, search), Tradeoffs (Real-time vs reliability, Privacy vs features), Success Metrics (Messages, response time, DAU, retention)"
- "Design WhatsApp group messages: Users (Group members, admins), Jobs (Send group messages, Organize, Manage), Core Loop (Receive → Read → Respond → Wait), Key Features (Group chat, admin controls, media, notifications), Tradeoffs (Group size vs performance, Privacy vs features), Success Metrics (Group messages, engagement, retention)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q337: Design a group chat application. (group chat design angle)
- Q359: Design a messaging platform. (messaging platform design angle)

- Q1545: How would you redesign Instagram's DM feature? (DM redesign angle)
- Q2879: You're the Product Manager at Beacon. What would you do to build an in-app chat feature? (in-app chat angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When designing a messaging platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics. First, I identify Users: Who are the users? (Individual users, Groups/teams, Businesses), What are their needs? (Real-time communication, Reliability, Privacy). Then I define Jobs: What jobs do users need done? (Send messages, Receive messages, Organize conversations, Share media/files), Prioritize by Urgency and Frequency. Next, I design Core Loop: What is the engagement loop? (Receive message → Read/respond → Send message → Wait for response), How does it drive retention? (Daily communication, Network effects). I design Key Features: Core features (Messaging, Notifications, Media sharing, File sharing), Supporting features (Search, Organization, Privacy, Group features). I consider Tradeoffs: Real-time vs reliability, Privacy vs features, Simplicity vs functionality. Finally, I define Success Metrics: Communication metrics (Messages sent/received, Response time, Delivery rate), Retention metrics (Daily active users, Network growth, Engagement). The key is designing a platform that's reliable, fast, and private."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q337 (Design group chat application):** Focus on group chat → "To design a group chat application, I'd: Users (Group members (individual users), Group admins, Businesses), Needs (Real-time group communication, Organization, Privacy, Control), Jobs (Send group messages, Receive messages, Organize conversations, Manage group, Share media), Core Loop (Receive group message → Read → Respond → Wait for responses → Return), Key Features (Group chat (multiple participants, real-time), Admin controls (add/remove members, manage settings), Media sharing (photos, videos, files), Notifications (group mentions, message alerts), Search (find messages, media), Organization (threads, pinned messages, reactions)), Tradeoffs (Group size vs performance - optimize for large groups, Real-time vs reliability - prioritize reliability, Privacy vs features - balance), Success Metrics (Communication: Messages sent/received, Response time, Delivery rate | Retention: Daily active users, Group engagement, Network growth). I'd prioritize real-time delivery, group management, and reliability."

- **Q374 (Design new feature for WhatsApp group messages):** Emphasize feature design → "To design a new feature for WhatsApp group messages, I'd: Users (Group members, Group admins), Needs (Better organization, More engagement, Privacy, Control), Jobs (Organize messages, Engage with content, Manage group, Find information), Core Loop (Receive message → Read → Engage with feature → Return), Key Features (New feature (e.g., message reactions, polls, threads, voice messages), Integration (works with existing features), Privacy (end-to-end encryption maintained), Admin controls (manage feature usage)), Tradeoffs (Features vs simplicity - keep simple, Privacy vs functionality - maintain privacy, Engagement vs organization - balance), Success Metrics (Feature usage: Adoption rate, engagement, retention | Communication: Messages, response time, group activity). I'd prioritize features that enhance engagement while maintaining simplicity and privacy."
