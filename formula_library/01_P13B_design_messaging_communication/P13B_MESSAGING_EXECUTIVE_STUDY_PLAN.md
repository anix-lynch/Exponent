## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13B_MESSAGING (DESIGN MESSAGING/COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "messaging" or "communication" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Messaging Keywords:
- "messaging", "communication", "chat", "DM", "notifications", "WhatsApp", "Slack"
- "send message", "receive message", "real-time", "group chat", "private messaging"
- "communication platform", "messaging app", "chat application"

### Implicit P13B_MESSAGING Indicators:
- **Messaging focus:** "Design a messaging app", "Design chat feature", "Design DM feature"
- **Communication focus:** "Design communication platform", "Design for real-time communication"
- **Notification focus:** "Design notifications", "Design alerts", "Design push notifications"
- **Group communication:** "Design group chat", "Design team communication", "Design collaboration"

### P13B_MESSAGING vs P13B_SOCIAL Distinction:
- **P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication):** "Design a messaging app" → Focus: Private communication, real-time, reliability
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Public sharing, feed, network

### P13B_MESSAGING vs P13C Distinction:
- **P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication):** "Design a messaging app" → Focus: Consumer communication, real-time
- **P13C (B2B/SaaS):** "Design a B2B product" → Focus: Enterprise workflow, adoption

### Red Flags (NOT P13B_MESSAGING):
- "Design a social media app" → P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community)
- "Design a B2B product" → P13C (B2B/SaaS)
- "Design a video streaming app" → P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Messaging Platform Design
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a messaging app" or "Design chat feature" - core messaging platform framework
- **Framework:** Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics
- **Users:** Who are the users? (Individual users, Groups/teams, Businesses), What are their needs? (Real-time communication, Reliability, Privacy)
- **Jobs:** What jobs do users need done? (Send messages, Receive messages, Organize conversations, Share media/files), Job priority (Urgency, Frequency)
- **Core Loop:** What is the engagement loop? (Receive message → Read/respond → Send message → Wait for response), How does it drive retention? (Daily communication, Network effects)
- **Key Features:** Core features (Messaging, Notifications, Media sharing, File sharing), Supporting features (Search, Organization, Privacy, Group features)
- **Tradeoffs:** Real-time vs reliability, Privacy vs features, Simplicity vs functionality
- **Success Metrics:** Communication metrics (Messages sent/received, Response time, Delivery rate), Retention metrics (Daily active users, Network growth, Engagement)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design messaging app: Users (Individual users, groups, businesses), Jobs (Send, receive, organize, share), Core Loop (Receive → Read → Respond → Wait), Key Features (Messaging, notifications, media, search), Tradeoffs (Real-time vs reliability, Privacy vs features), Success Metrics (Messages, response time, DAU, retention)"
- "Design WhatsApp group messages: Users (Group members, admins), Jobs (Send group messages, Organize, Manage), Core Loop (Receive → Read → Respond → Wait), Key Features (Group chat, admin controls, media, notifications), Tradeoffs (Group size vs performance, Privacy vs features), Success Metrics (Group messages, engagement, retention)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q337: Design a group chat application. (group chat design angle)
- Q359: Design a messaging platform. (messaging platform design angle)
- Q374: Design a new feature for WhatsApp group messages. (feature design angle)
- Q1545: How would you redesign Instagram's DM feature? (DM redesign angle)
- Q2879: You're the Product Manager at Beacon. What would you do to build an in-app chat feature? (in-app chat angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing a messaging platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics.

**1️⃣ Users** → Who are the users? (Individual users, Groups/teams, Businesses), What are their needs? (Real-time communication, Reliability, Privacy).

**2️⃣ Jobs** → What jobs do users need done? (Send messages, Receive messages, Organize conversations, Share media/files), Prioritize by Urgency and Frequency.

**3️⃣ Core Loop** → What is the engagement loop? (Receive message → Read/respond → Send message → Wait for response), How does it drive retention? (Daily communication, Network effects).

**4️⃣ Key Features** → Core features (Messaging, Notifications, Media sharing, File sharing), Supporting features (Search, Organization, Privacy, Group features).

**5️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Real-time vs reliability, Privacy vs features, Simplicity vs functionality.

**6️⃣ Success Metrics** → Communication metrics (Messages sent/received, Response time, Delivery rate), Retention metrics (Daily active users, Network growth, Engagement).

**Key Principle:** Design a platform that's reliable, fast, and private.

**Memorizable Answer:**

When focusing on real-time communication, I use the same messaging platform framework but emphasize real-time delivery and reliability.

**1️⃣ Users & Jobs** → Identify users and their jobs to understand communication needs.

**2️⃣ Core Loop (Real-Time Focus)** → Entry point (How users receive - push notification, in-app, open app), Core action (Send message, Receive message, Respond), Reward (Instant delivery, Reliable communication, Fast response), Return trigger (New messages, Notifications, Real-time updates).

**3️⃣ Key Features (Real-Time)** → Message delivery (Instant delivery, Reliability, Message ordering, Delivery status), Notifications (Push notifications, In-app notifications, Delivery status, Read receipts), Reliability (Delivery guarantees, Retry logic, Offline support, Sync), Real-time updates (Typing indicators, Online status, Message status).

**4️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Real-time vs reliability (prioritize reliability), Privacy vs features (maintain privacy), Simplicity vs functionality (keep simple).

**5️⃣ Success Metrics** → Real-time metrics (Delivery rate, Response time, Reliability, Latency), Communication (Messages sent/received, Engagement), Retention (DAU, Network growth).

**Key Principle:** Make communication instant, reliable, and private.
