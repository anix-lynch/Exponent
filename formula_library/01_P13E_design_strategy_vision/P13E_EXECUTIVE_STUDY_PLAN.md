## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13E (DESIGN STRATEGY / VISION / ROADMAPPING) QUESTIONS

**Even when "strategy" or "roadmap" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Strategy Keywords:
- "strategy", "vision", "roadmap", "roadmap planning", "strategic"
- "5-year", "10-year", "long-term", "next product", "what should X build next?"
- "define roadmap", "develop roadmap", "product roadmap", "innovation roadmap"

### Implicit P13E Indicators:
- **Roadmap questions:** "Define a roadmap", "Design a roadmap", "Build a roadmap"
- **Strategic questions:** "What product should X build next?", "What strategy would you pursue?"
- **Vision questions:** "Long-term vision", "Strategic bets", "Product vision"
- **Future focus:** "5-10 years", "next 3 years", "long-term", "future"

### P13E vs P13A-P13D Distinction:
- **P13E (Strategy/Vision):** "Define a 10-year roadmap" → Focus: Long-term strategy, vision, phasing
- **P13A-P13D (Product Design):** "Design a product" → Focus: Specific product design, immediate features

### P13E vs P9 Distinction:
- **P13E (Strategy/Vision):** "Define a roadmap" → Focus: Long-term strategy, vision, roadmap
- **P9 (Decision Under Uncertainty):** "Should we build X?" → Focus: Decision-making under uncertainty

### Red Flags (NOT P13E):
- "Design a specific product" → P13A-P13D (Product Design)
- "Should we build X?" → P9 (Decision Under Uncertainty)
- "How to improve X?" → P1-P3 (Metrics/Funnel)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Roadmap Planning
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Define a roadmap" or "Design a roadmap" - core roadmap framework
- **Framework:** Vision → User Segments → Strategic Bets → Phasing → Risks
- **Vision:** What is the long-term vision? (Company mission, Market opportunity, Competitive landscape), Why now? (Market timing, Technology readiness, Competitive window)
- **User Segments:** Who are the target users? (Primary segments, Secondary segments, Future segments), How do segments evolve? (Current needs, Future needs)
- **Strategic Bets:** What are the big bets? (Product bets, Market bets, Technology bets), Why these bets? (Potential impact, Probability of success, Strategic alignment)
- **Phasing:** How to phase the roadmap? (Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Growth, Phase 3: Scale), Dependencies (Technical dependencies, Market dependencies, Resource dependencies)
- **Risks:** What are the risks? (Market risks, Technology risks, Competitive risks), Risk mitigation (Diversification, Optionality, Exit strategies)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Define 10-year roadmap: Vision (Long-term vision, market opportunity, competitive landscape), User Segments (Current and future segments, evolving needs), Strategic Bets (Big bets with high impact, strategic alignment), Phasing (Foundation → Growth → Scale, dependencies), Risks (Market, technology, competitive risks, mitigation)"
- "Design 3-year roadmap: Vision (3-year vision, market opportunity), User Segments (Target segments, evolving needs), Strategic Bets (Key bets, impact, probability), Phasing (Year 1: Foundation, Year 2: Growth, Year 3: Scale), Risks (Risks and mitigation)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q187: Define a 10-year roadmap for Google Maps. (long-term roadmap angle)
- Q186: Define a 1-year roadmap for WhatsApp in India. (short-term roadmap angle)
- Q2796: You're a PM for Gmail. Design a three-year product roadmap. (3-year roadmap angle)
- Q2799: You're a PM for Google Chrome on large screens. Build the three-year innovation roadmap. (innovation roadmap angle)
- Q432: Design a product roadmap for Flipkart's Seller Hub mobile app. (product roadmap angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When defining a roadmap, I use Vision → User Segments → Strategic Bets → Phasing → Risks. First, I define Vision: What is the long-term vision? (Company mission, Market opportunity, Competitive landscape), Why now? (Market timing, Technology readiness, Competitive window). Then I identify User Segments: Who are the target users? (Primary segments, Secondary segments, Future segments), How do segments evolve? (Current needs, Future needs). Next, I define Strategic Bets: What are the big bets? (Product bets, Market bets, Technology bets), Why these bets? (Potential impact, Probability of success, Strategic alignment). I phase the roadmap: How to phase? (Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Growth, Phase 3: Scale), Dependencies (Technical dependencies, Market dependencies, Resource dependencies). Finally, I assess Risks: What are the risks? (Market risks, Technology risks, Competitive risks), Risk mitigation (Diversification, Optionality, Exit strategies). The goal is a vision-driven roadmap that's phased, strategic, and risk-aware."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q187 (Define 10-year roadmap for Google Maps):** Focus on long-term roadmap → "To define a 10-year roadmap for Google Maps, I'd: Vision (Long-term vision: Become the definitive platform for location intelligence and navigation, Market opportunity: Growing need for location services, autonomous vehicles, AR, Competitive landscape: Apple Maps, Waze, emerging players, Why now: AR/VR ready, autonomous vehicles emerging, competitive window), User Segments (Primary: Consumers (navigation, discovery), Secondary: Businesses (local search, advertising), Future: Autonomous vehicles, AR users, How segments evolve: From navigation to location intelligence, from 2D to 3D/AR), Strategic Bets (Product bets: AR navigation, indoor mapping, autonomous vehicle integration, Market bets: Expand to new markets, verticals, Technology bets: AI/ML for personalization, real-time updates, Why these bets: High impact, strategic alignment, technology ready), Phasing (Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Foundation - AR features, indoor mapping, AI personalization, Phase 2 (Years 4-7): Growth - Autonomous vehicle integration, new markets, Phase 3 (Years 8-10): Scale - Platform dominance, new verticals, Dependencies: AR/VR technology, autonomous vehicle adoption, market readiness), Risks (Market risks: Competition, technology shifts, Technology risks: AR/VR adoption, autonomous vehicles, Competitive risks: Apple Maps, new entrants, Risk mitigation: Diversification, optionality, partnerships). I'd prioritize foundation first, then growth, then scale."

- **Q186 (Define 1-year roadmap for WhatsApp in India):** Emphasize short-term roadmap → "To define a 1-year roadmap for WhatsApp in India, I'd: Vision (1-year vision: Strengthen WhatsApp's position in India, expand features, Market opportunity: India is key market, growing internet users, Competitive landscape: Telegram, Signal, local players, Why now: Market growth, competitive pressure, feature gaps), User Segments (Primary: Consumers (messaging, payments), Secondary: Businesses (WhatsApp Business), How segments evolve: From messaging to commerce, payments), Strategic Bets (Product bets: Payments expansion, business features, Market bets: Rural expansion, vertical focus, Why these bets: High impact in India, strategic alignment), Phasing (Q1: Payments expansion, Q2: Business features, Q3: Rural expansion, Q4: New features, Dependencies: Regulatory approval, infrastructure, partnerships), Risks (Market risks: Competition, regulation, Technology risks: Infrastructure, adoption, Risk mitigation: Gradual rollout, partnerships). I'd focus on payments and business features as key bets."
