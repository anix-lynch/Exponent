## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13E (DESIGN STRATEGY / VISION / ROADMAPPING) QUESTIONS

**Even when "strategy" or "roadmap" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Strategy Keywords:
- "strategy", "vision", "roadmap", "roadmap planning", "strategic"
- "5-year", "10-year", "long-term", "next product", "what should X build next?"
- "define roadmap", "develop roadmap", "product roadmap", "innovation roadmap"

### Implicit P13E Indicators:
- **Roadmap questions:** "Define a roadmap", "Design a roadmap", "Build a roadmap"
- **Strategic questions:** "What product should X build next?", "What strategy would you pursue?"
- **Vision questions:** "Long-term vision", "Strategic bets", "Product vision"
- **Future focus:** "5-10 years", "next 3 years", "long-term", "future"

### P13E vs P13A-P13D Distinction:
- **P13E (Strategy/Vision):** "Define a 10-year roadmap" → Focus: Long-term strategy, vision, phasing
- **P13A-P13D (Product Design):** "Design a product" → Focus: Specific product design, immediate features

### P13E vs P9 Distinction:
- **P13E (Strategy/Vision):** "Define a roadmap" → Focus: Long-term strategy, vision, roadmap
- **P9 (Decision Under Uncertainty):** "Should we build X?" → Focus: Decision-making under uncertainty

### Red Flags (NOT P13E):
- "Design a specific product" → P13A-P13D (Product Design)
- "Should we build X?" → P9 (Decision Under Uncertainty)
- "How to improve X?" → P1-P3 (Metrics/Funnel)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Roadmap Planning
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Define a roadmap" or "Design a roadmap" - core roadmap framework
- **Framework:** Vision → User Segments → Strategic Bets → Phasing → Risks
- **Vision:** What is the long-term vision? (Company mission, Market opportunity, Competitive landscape), Why now? (Market timing, Technology readiness, Competitive window)
- **User Segments:** Who are the target users? (Primary segments, Secondary segments, Future segments), How do segments evolve? (Current needs, Future needs)
- **Strategic Bets:** What are the big bets? (Product bets, Market bets, Technology bets), Why these bets? (Potential impact, Probability of success, Strategic alignment)
- **Phasing:** How to phase the roadmap? (Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Growth, Phase 3: Scale), Dependencies (Technical dependencies, Market dependencies, Resource dependencies)
- **Risks:** What are the risks? (Market risks, Technology risks, Competitive risks), Risk mitigation (Diversification, Optionality, Exit strategies)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Define 10-year roadmap: Vision (Long-term vision, market opportunity, competitive landscape), User Segments (Current and future segments, evolving needs), Strategic Bets (Big bets with high impact, strategic alignment), Phasing (Foundation → Growth → Scale, dependencies), Risks (Market, technology, competitive risks, mitigation)"
- "Design 3-year roadmap: Vision (3-year vision, market opportunity), User Segments (Target segments, evolving needs), Strategic Bets (Key bets, impact, probability), Phasing (Year 1: Foundation, Year 2: Growth, Year 3: Scale), Risks (Risks and mitigation)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q187: Define a 10-year roadmap for Google Maps. (long-term roadmap angle)
- Q186: Define a 1-year roadmap for WhatsApp in India. (short-term roadmap angle)
- Q2796: You're a PM for Gmail. Design a three-year product roadmap. (3-year roadmap angle)
- Q2799: You're a PM for Google Chrome on large screens. Build the three-year innovation roadmap. (innovation roadmap angle)
- Q432: Design a product roadmap for Flipkart's Seller Hub mobile app. (product roadmap angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Vision → User Segments → Strategic Bets → Phasing → Risks`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When defining a roadmap, I use Vision → User Segments → Strategic Bets → Phasing → Risks.

**1️⃣ Vision** → What is the long-term vision? (Company mission, Market opportunity, Competitive landscape), Why now? (Market timing, Technology readiness, Competitive window).

**2️⃣ User Segments** → Who are the target users? (Primary segments, Secondary segments, Future segments), How do segments evolve? (Current needs, Future needs).

**3️⃣ Strategic Bets** → What are the big bets? (Product bets, Market bets, Technology bets), Why these bets? (Potential impact, Probability of success, Strategic alignment).

**4️⃣ Phasing** → How to phase? (Phase 1: Foundation, Phase 2: Growth, Phase 3: Scale), Dependencies (Technical dependencies, Market dependencies, Resource dependencies).

**5️⃣ Risks** → What are the risks? (Market risks, Technology risks, Competitive risks), Risk mitigation (Diversification, Optionality, Exit strategies).

**Key Principle:** Vision-driven roadmap that's phased, strategic, and risk-aware.
