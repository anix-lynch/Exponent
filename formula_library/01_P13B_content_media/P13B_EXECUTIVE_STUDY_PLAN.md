## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13B_CONTENT (DESIGN CONTENT/MEDIA PLATFORMS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "content" or "media" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Content Keywords:
- "content", "media", "streaming", "video", "audio", "podcast"
- "Netflix", "YouTube", "Spotify", "streaming service", "video platform"
- "watch", "listen", "consume", "discover content", "recommendation"

### Implicit P13B_CONTENT Indicators:
- **Content focus:** "Design a video streaming app", "Design a podcast platform", "Design for Netflix"
- **Consumption focus:** "Design for watching", "Design for listening", "Design content discovery"
- **Creator focus:** "Design for creators", "Design creator tools", "Design monetization"
- **Recommendation focus:** "Design recommendation engine", "Design discovery", "Design personalization"

### P13B_CONTENT vs P13B_SOCIAL Distinction:
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption, discovery, watch time
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Connection, network effects, community

### P13B_CONTENT vs P13B_MESSAGING Distinction:
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption, passive engagement
- **P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication):** "Design a messaging app" → Focus: Real-time communication, active engagement

### Red Flags (NOT P13B_CONTENT):
- "Design a social media app" → P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community)
- "Design a messaging app" → P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication)
- "Design an e-commerce app" → P13B_ECOMMERCE (E-commerce/Shopping)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Content Platform Design
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a video streaming app" or "Design a content platform" - core content platform framework
- **Framework:** Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics
- **Users:** Who are the users? (Content creators, Viewers/consumers, Advertisers if applicable), What are their needs? (Content discovery, Quality content, Monetization for creators)
- **Jobs:** What jobs do users need done? (Discover content, Consume content, Create content, Monetize content), Job priority (Frequency, Importance)
- **Core Loop:** What is the engagement loop? (Discover content → Watch/consume → Engage (like, comment) → Return for more), How does it drive retention? (Content library, Personalized recommendations)
- **Key Features:** Core features (Content library, Recommendation engine, Player/viewer, Creator tools), Supporting features (Search, Playlists, Social features)
- **Tradeoffs:** Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs viewer experience, Free vs paid content
- **Success Metrics:** Consumption metrics (Watch time, Completion rate, Sessions per user), Creator metrics (Creator satisfaction, Content upload rate)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design video streaming: Users (Content creators, Viewers, Advertisers), Jobs (Discover, watch, create, monetize), Core Loop (Discover → Watch → Engage → Return), Key Features (Library, recommendations, player, creator tools), Tradeoffs (Quality vs quantity, Creator vs viewer), Success Metrics (Watch time, completion rate, creator satisfaction)"
- "Design podcast platform: Users (Podcast creators, Listeners), Jobs (Discover podcasts, Listen, Create, Monetize), Core Loop (Discover → Listen → Subscribe → Return), Key Features (Library, recommendations, player, creator tools), Tradeoffs (Quality vs quantity, Creator vs listener), Success Metrics (Listen time, subscriptions, creator satisfaction)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q50: As a PM at Netflix, design something for kids. (content platform design angle)
- Q494: Design a streaming service like Netflix. (streaming service design angle)
- Q397: Design a podcast platform. (podcast platform design angle)
- Q375: Design a new feature for YouTube. (feature design angle)
- Q667: Design the 'Top Picks' feature for Netflix. (recommendation feature angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing a content platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics.

**1️⃣ Users** → Who are the users? (Content creators, Viewers/consumers, Advertisers if applicable), What are their needs? (Content discovery, Quality content, Monetization for creators).

**2️⃣ Jobs** → What jobs do users need done? (Discover content, Consume content, Create content, Monetize content), Prioritize by Frequency and Importance.

**3️⃣ Core Loop** → What is the engagement loop? (Discover content → Watch/consume → Engage (like, comment) → Return for more), How does it drive retention? (Content library, Personalized recommendations).

**4️⃣ Key Features** → Core features (Content library, Recommendation engine, Player/viewer, Creator tools), Supporting features (Search, Playlists, Social features).

**5️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs viewer experience, Free vs paid content.

**6️⃣ Success Metrics** → Consumption metrics (Watch time, Completion rate, Sessions per user), Creator metrics (Creator satisfaction, Content upload rate).

**Key Principle:** Design a core loop that drives content consumption and creator satisfaction.

  - "Tradeoffs: Quality vs quantity (prioritize quality), Educational vs entertainment (balance both), Parent control vs kid freedom (balance)"
  - "Success Metrics: Consumption (watch time, completion rate, sessions), Retention (Day 1/7/30 retention, Parent satisfaction, Content library size)"
  - "Prioritize safety, age-appropriateness, and parental controls"

- **Q494 (Design streaming service like Netflix):** Emphasize streaming platform

### BUCKET 2: Content Discovery & Recommendation
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design recommendation engine" or "Design discovery" - same framework, with focus on discovery
- **Approach:** Same content platform framework, with focus on content discovery and recommendation
- **Discovery Strategy:** Personalized recommendations (ML-based, User preferences, Content similarity), Search (Powerful search, Filters, Categories), Trending (Popular content, New releases, Editor's picks)
- **Recommendation Engine:** Input signals (User behavior, Content metadata, Similar users), Algorithm (Collaborative filtering, Content-based, Hybrid), Success metrics (Click-through rate, Watch time, Completion rate)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design recommendation: Personalized (ML-based, user preferences), Search (powerful, filters), Trending (popular, new), Success metrics (CTR, watch time, completion)"
- "Improve discovery: Optimize recommendation algorithm, Improve search, Add trending, Measure discovery metrics"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q667: Design the 'Top Picks' feature for Netflix. (recommendation feature angle)
- Q1312: How would you design the YouTube landing page? (discovery design angle)
- Q277: Design a chess board and a Netflix recommendation engine. (recommendation engine angle)
- Q50: As a PM at Netflix, design something for kids. (personalized content angle)
- Q375: Design a new feature for YouTube. (discovery feature angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop (Discovery Focus) → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When focusing on content discovery and recommendation, I use the same content platform framework but emphasize discovery and personalization.

**1️⃣ Users & Jobs** → Identify users and their jobs to understand what content they want.

**2️⃣ Core Loop (Discovery Focus)** → Entry point (How users discover - homepage, search, recommendations), Core action (Browse, search, watch), Reward (Find relevant content, personalized recommendations), Return trigger (New content, recommendations, trending).

**3️⃣ Key Features (Discovery)** → Recommendation engine (Personalized, ML-based, User preferences, Content similarity), Search (Powerful search, Filters, Categories), Trending (Popular content, New releases, Editor's picks), Homepage (Personalized rows, Recommendations, Continue watching).

**4️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Personalization vs diversity (balance), Quality vs quantity (prioritize quality), Creator vs viewer (support both).

**5️⃣ Success Metrics** → Discovery metrics (Click-through rate, Watch time from recommendations, Completion rate), Engagement (Sessions, Time spent, Retention).

**Key Principle:** Make it easy to discover relevant content through personalization and search.
