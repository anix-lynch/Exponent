## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P14 (REVENUE OPTIMIZATION / GROWTH) QUESTIONS

**Even when "revenue" or "optimization" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Revenue Keywords:
- "increase revenue", "revenue optimization", "revenue growth", "monetize", "monetization"
- "increase sales", "grow revenue", "revenue by X%", "10x revenue", "triple revenue"
- "pricing", "pricing strategy", "price optimization", "AOV", "ARPU"

### Implicit P14 Indicators:
- **Growth questions:** "How would you 10x X?", "How would you grow X?", "How would you increase X?"
- **Revenue questions:** "How would you increase revenue?", "How would you monetize X?", "How would you price X?"
- **Optimization questions:** "How would you optimize revenue?", "How would you improve AOV?", "How would you increase conversion?"
- **Pricing questions:** "How would you price X?", "Pricing strategy", "Should we change pricing?"

### P14 vs P1 Distinction:
- **P14 (Revenue Optimization):** "How would you increase revenue?" → Focus: OPTIMIZE revenue (Levers → Test → Measure → Iterate)
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Revenue dropped 25%" → Focus: DIAGNOSE why revenue dropped

### P14 vs P3 Distinction:
- **P14 (Revenue Optimization):** "How would you increase revenue?" → Focus: Revenue levers (Price, Volume, Mix)
- **P3 (Funnel Analysis):** "55% drop at checkout" → Focus: Funnel drop-off analysis

### P14 vs P8 Distinction:
- **P14 (Revenue Optimization):** "How would you increase revenue?" → Focus: Revenue strategy and levers
- **P8 (Experiment Design):** "How would you test X?" → Focus: Experiment design methodology

### Red Flags (NOT P14):
- "Revenue dropped 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)
- "55% drop at checkout" → P3 (Funnel Analysis)
- "How would you test X?" → P8 (Experiment Design)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Levers (Price, Volume, Mix) → Test → Measure → Iterate`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When optimizing revenue, I use Levers (Price, Volume, Mix) → Test → Measure → Iterate.

**1️⃣ Levers** → 
  - **Price:** Pricing strategy (increase price, optimize tiers, dynamic pricing), Price elasticity (test sensitivity, find optimal point)
  - **Volume:** User acquisition (increase new users, improve conversion), Engagement (increase frequency, session depth, feature adoption), Retention (reduce churn, improve LTV)
  - **Mix:** Product mix (optimize portfolio, cross-sell, upsell), Customer mix (focus high-value segments, improve ARPU), Channel mix (optimize channels, improve CAC efficiency)

**2️⃣ Test** → Design experiments (A/B tests, phased rollouts, market tests), Test one lever at a time to isolate impact, Control for external factors (seasonality, market conditions, statistical significance).

**3️⃣ Measure** → Primary metric (Revenue impact - total revenue, ARPU, LTV), Secondary metrics (Conversion rate, retention, engagement), Guardrails (Monitor churn, user satisfaction, brand impact), Time horizon (Short-term vs long-term impact).

**4️⃣ Iterate** → If successful (Scale the change, expand to more segments), If mixed (Refine the lever, test variations), If unsuccessful (Try different lever, pivot strategy).

**Key Principle:** Test systematically and iterate based on results.
