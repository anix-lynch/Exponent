## 📌 Sample: Revenue Optimization

**Question:**
"How would you increase revenue for [product]?"

**Answer Framework:**

1. **Levers**: Identify revenue optimization opportunities across Price (pricing strategy, price elasticity), Volume (user acquisition, engagement, retention), and Mix (product mix, customer mix, channel mix).

2. **Test**: Run experiments to validate levers (A/B tests, phased rollouts, market tests). Test one lever at a time to isolate impact. Control for external factors (seasonality, market conditions) and ensure statistical significance.

3. **Measure**: Track impact on revenue and key metrics. Primary metric: revenue impact (total revenue, ARPU, LTV). Secondary metrics: conversion rate, retention, engagement. Guardrails: monitor churn, user satisfaction, brand impact. Time horizon: short-term vs long-term revenue impact.

4. **Iterate**: Refine and optimize based on results. If successful: scale the change, expand to more segments. If mixed: refine the lever, test variations. If unsuccessful: try different lever, pivot strategy. Continuous optimization: revenue is not one-time, keep testing and improving.

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **Three levers**: Price, Volume, Mix - optimize all three
- **Test-driven**: Always validate with experiments
- **Guardrails**: Monitor negative impacts (churn, satisfaction)
- **Iterative**: Revenue optimization is continuous, not one-time
