## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY L12 (METRICS INTERPRETATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "metrics interpretation" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Metrics Interpretation Keywords:
- "metric interpretation", "what does this metric mean", "is this metric good", "metric moved"
- "proxy", "vanity metric", "gaming", "Simpson's paradox", "metric validity"
- "should we care", "is this good", "what does this tell us"

### Implicit L12 Indicators:
- **Interpretation questions:** "Signup conversion increased 10%. Is that good?", "What does this metric mean?", "Should we care about this change?"
- **Proxy questions:** "Is this a good proxy?", "Does this metric mean what we think?", "Proxy validity"
- **Gaming questions:** "Can this be gamed?", "Is this being manipulated?", "Metric gaming"

### L12 vs P1 Distinction:
- **L12 (Metrics Interpretation):** "Is this metric good?" → Focus: Does metric mean what we think? Can it be gamed? Should we care?
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Orders down 25%" → Focus: WHERE is drop coming from? (Segment to find hot spot)

### L12 vs L1 Distinction:
- **L12 (Metrics Interpretation):** "Is this metric good?" → Focus: Proxy validity, gaming risk, interpretation
- **L1 (Data Trust):** "Debug a metric that was off" → Focus: Is data trustworthy? (Source, freshness, completeness)

### Red Flags (NOT L12):
- "Orders down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)
- "Debug a metric that was off" → L1 (Data Trust)
- "How do you define success?" → P2 (NSM + KPI Ladder)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Metrics Interpretation Framework
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Signup conversion increased 10%. Is that good?" or "What does this metric mean?" - core metrics interpretation framework
- **Framework:** Metric Moved → Proxy Validity → Gaming Risk → Context Checks → Decide
- **Metric Moved:** What exactly changed? (Direction: up/down/flat, Magnitude: small blip vs step-change, Scope: which segment, surface, cohort, Time: one day spike vs sustained trend, Aggregation level: overall vs segment-level - check for Simpson's paradox), Rule: Never react to a single datapoint
- **Proxy Validity:** Does this metric mean what we think? (Is it a proxy or the real goal?, How tightly correlated to value?, Leading vs lagging?, Any known blind spots?), Example: CTR ↑ but satisfaction ↓ → weak proxy
- **Gaming & Incentives:** Can it be manipulated? (By users? Spam, bots, churn masking, By teams? Optimize metric, hurt product, By design? Dark patterns, forced clicks, By reporting? Definition drift), Rule: If it's tied to goals/bonuses, it WILL be gamed
- **Context Checks:** Is this causal? (Seasonality?, Launches/experiments?, External events?, Data pipeline issues?, Aggregation bias? Simpson's paradox?, Correlation vs causation)
- **Decide:** Now what? (Ignore → noise or bad proxy, Monitor → unclear, need more data, Investigate → signal but ambiguous, Act → strong signal + aligned proxy), Output: "We believe X changed because Y, so we will Z."

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Signup conversion ↑ 10%: Metric (Direction: up, Magnitude: 10%, Scope: all users, Time: sustained), Proxy (Does signup → activation? Weak link), Gaming (Forced signup wall introduced), Context (Marketing campaign changed traffic mix), Decision (Investigate activation + retention before celebrating)"
- "Metrics interpretation: Check what moved, validate proxy, assess gaming risk, check context, decide"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q144: Can a university have a lower overall acceptance rate for female-identifying students, even if every department admits them at a higher rate than others? (Simpson's paradox/metric interpretation angle)
- Q110: As the owner of a gas station observing a sudden surge in customers, reaching four times the usual capacity during peak times, how would you investigate, diagnose, and resolve this issue? (metric interpretation angle)
- Q117: As the PM for Lyft, what dashboard would you build to track the health of the app? (metric interpretation angle)
- Q183: Debug a metric that was off by x percentage. (metric interpretation angle)
- Q790: Explain data drifting. (metric interpretation angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Metric Moved → Proxy Validity → Gaming Risk → Context Checks → Decide`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When interpreting metrics, I use Metric Moved → Proxy Validity → Gaming Risk → Context Checks → Decide.

**1️⃣ Metric Moved** → What exactly changed?
  - **Direction:** Up/down/flat (which direction did the metric move?)
  - **Magnitude:** Small blip vs step-change (how significant is the change?)
  - **Scope:** Which segment, surface, cohort (where is the change happening?)
  - **Time:** One day spike vs sustained trend (is this temporary or ongoing?)
  - **Aggregation level:** Overall metric vs segment-level metrics (check for Simpson's paradox)

**Rule:** Never react to a single datapoint.

**2️⃣ Proxy Validity** → Does this metric mean what we think?
  - **Is it a proxy or the real goal?** Is this metric a stand-in for something else, or the actual outcome?
  - **How tightly correlated to value?** Does this metric actually predict business value or user satisfaction?
  - **Leading vs lagging?** Is this a leading indicator (predicts future) or lagging indicator (reflects past)?
  - **Any known blind spots?** Are there scenarios where this metric is misleading or incomplete?

**Example:** CTR ↑ but satisfaction ↓ → weak proxy.

**3️⃣ Gaming & Incentives** → Can it be manipulated?
  - **By users?** Spam, bots, churn masking (are users gaming the system?)
  - **By teams?** Optimize metric, hurt product (are teams optimizing for the metric at the expense of real value?)
  - **By design?** Dark patterns, forced clicks (is the product design encouraging manipulation?)
  - **By reporting?** Definition drift (are we changing how we measure this over time?)

**Rule:** If it's tied to goals/bonuses, it WILL be gamed.

**4️⃣ Context Checks** → Is this causal?
  - **Seasonality?** Is this a seasonal pattern we've seen before?
  - **Launches/experiments?** Did we recently launch a feature or run an experiment?
  - **External events?** Are there external factors (news, holidays, market changes) affecting this?
  - **Data pipeline issues?** Could this be a data quality problem or reporting error?
  - **Aggregation bias?** Is the overall metric hiding important segment-level differences (Simpson's paradox)?
  - **Correlation vs causation:** Is this change actually caused by what we think, or just correlated?

**5️⃣ Decide** → Now what?
  - **Ignore:** Noise or bad proxy (not worth acting on)
  - **Monitor:** Unclear, need more data (watch and wait)
  - **Investigate:** Signal but ambiguous (dig deeper)
  - **Act:** Strong signal + aligned proxy (take action)

**Output:** "We believe X changed because Y, so we will Z."

**Key Principle:** A metric moving is not the same as progress. Proxies decay over time. If a metric becomes a target, it stops being a metric. Context beats dashboards.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q144 (Simpson's paradox):** Focus on aggregation bias
  - "Metric Moved: Overall acceptance rate (lower for female-identifying students), Department-level (higher acceptance rate for female-identifying students in every department), Aggregation level (overall metric vs segment-level metrics - this is Simpson's paradox), Direction (down at overall level, up at department level), Magnitude (significant difference), Scope (overall vs department-level), Time (sustained pattern)"
  - "Proxy Validity: Is overall acceptance rate a good proxy? No (it's misleading when departments have different application rates), How correlated to fairness? Weak (overall rate doesn't reflect department-level fairness), Blind spots (overall rate hides department-level differences)"
  - "Gaming Risk: Can it be gamed? Yes (by changing department application rates), By design (department selection could be manipulated)"
  - "Context Checks: Is this causal? No (it's an aggregation artifact), Seasonality (no), Launches (no), External events (no), Data pipeline (no), Aggregation bias (yes - this is Simpson's paradox - overall metric is misleading when departments have different application rates)"
  - "Decide: Investigate (need to look at department-level rates, not overall), Act (use department-level rates for fairness assessment, not overall rate)"
  - "Explain: Simpson's paradox occurs when overall metric shows opposite trend from segment-level metrics. Here, overall acceptance rate is lower for female-identifying students, but every department accepts them at higher rates. This happens because departments with lower acceptance rates (harder to get into) receive more applications from female-identifying students. The overall rate is misleading - we should look at department-level rates for fairness assessment"

- **Q110 (Gas station surge interpretation):** Emphasize metric interpretation
  - "Metric Moved: Direction (up - 4x increase), Magnitude (large - 4x is significant), Scope (all customers, peak times), Time (sudden surge - not sustained), Aggregation level (overall vs time-based)"
  - "Proxy Validity: Is customer count a good proxy? Yes (directly measures demand), How correlated to business value? High (more customers = more revenue), Leading vs lagging (leading - predicts revenue), Blind spots (doesn't show customer satisfaction, wait times)"
  - "Gaming Risk: Can it be gamed? No (real customers), By teams (no), By design (no), By reporting (no)"
  - "Context Checks: Is this causal? Need to investigate (could be: event nearby, promotion, competitor issue, seasonality, external event), Data pipeline (check if data is accurate)"
  - "Decide: Investigate (need to understand cause), Act (if real surge, need to handle capacity, If data issue, fix data)"
  - "Interpret: 4x surge is significant - need to investigate cause and handle capacity. Not a proxy issue - customer count is direct metric. Need context: What caused surge? Is it real? How to handle?"

### BUCKET 2: Metric Traps & Gaming
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Is this a vanity metric?" or "Can this be gamed?" - same framework, with focus on traps
- **Approach:** Same metrics interpretation framework, with focus on common traps
- **Common Traps:** Vanity metric (Pageviews with no engagement), Proxy drift (CTR no longer predicts retention), Metric cannibalization (Time spent ↑ but content quality ↓), Local optimization (Team wins, company loses), Dashboard blindness (Green metrics, red user experience)
- **Gaming Prevention:** Don't tie metrics to bonuses, Use multiple metrics, Monitor counter-metrics, Focus on user value

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Vanity metric: Pageviews ↑ but engagement ↓ → Weak proxy, being gamed"
- "Metric traps: Identify vanity metrics, proxy drift, gaming, local optimization"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q144: Can a university have a lower overall acceptance rate for female-identifying students, even if every department admits them at a higher rate than others? (Simpson's paradox/trap angle)
- Q110: As the owner of a gas station observing a sudden surge in customers, reaching four times the usual capacity during peak times, how would you investigate, diagnose, and resolve this issue? (metric interpretation/trap angle)
- Q117: As the PM for Lyft, what dashboard would you build to track the health of the app? (metric interpretation/trap angle)
- Q183: Debug a metric that was off by x percentage. (metric interpretation/trap angle)
- Q790: Explain data drifting. (metric interpretation/trap angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Metric Moved → Proxy Validity → Gaming Risk → Context Checks → Decide (Traps Focus)`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When identifying metric traps and gaming, I use the same metrics interpretation framework but focus on traps.

**1️⃣ Check for Vanity Metrics** → Pageviews with no engagement, signups with no activation, downloads with no usage.

**2️⃣ Check for Proxy Drift** → CTR no longer predicts retention, signup rate doesn't predict LTV.

**3️⃣ Check for Metric Cannibalization** → Time spent ↑ but content quality ↓, engagement ↑ but satisfaction ↓.

**4️⃣ Check for Local Optimization** → Team wins (optimizes their metric), company loses (hurts overall value).

**5️⃣ Check for Dashboard Blindness** → Green metrics (all metrics look good), red user experience (users unhappy).

**6️⃣ Prevent Gaming** → 
  - **Don't tie metrics to bonuses:** If tied to goals/bonuses, it WILL be gamed
  - **Use multiple metrics:** Don't optimize single metric
  - **Monitor counter-metrics:** Track what might be hurt
  - **Focus on user value:** Optimize for real value, not metrics

**Key Principle:** A metric moving is not the same as progress. Proxies decay over time. If a metric becomes a target, it stops being a metric.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q144 (Simpson's paradox trap):** Focus on aggregation trap
  - "This is a classic aggregation trap (Simpson's paradox). The overall metric (acceptance rate) is misleading because it aggregates across departments with different application rates"
  - "Check: Vanity metric? No (acceptance rate is meaningful), Proxy drift? No (it's a direct metric), Metric cannibalization? No, Local optimization? No, Dashboard blindness? Yes (overall metric looks bad, but department-level metrics look good)"
  - "The trap is using overall metric when segment-level metrics tell different story"
  - "Prevent: Use department-level rates for fairness assessment, Don't optimize overall rate alone, Monitor both overall and segment-level metrics, Focus on fairness at department level, not overall"
