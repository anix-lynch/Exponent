## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15 (BEHAVIORAL) QUESTIONS

**Even when "behavioral" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Behavioral Keywords:
- "tell me about a time", "describe a time", "give me an example", "walk me through"
- "situation", "challenge", "problem", "failure", "mistake", "conflict"
- "how did you", "what did you do", "how would you handle"

### Implicit P15 Indicators:
- **Past experience questions:** "Tell me about a time when...", "Describe a situation where...", "Give me an example of..."
- **Behavioral questions:** "How do you handle...", "What's your approach to...", "How would you deal with..."
- **STAR format:** Questions asking for Situation, Task, Action, Result
- **Soft skills:** Leadership, collaboration, conflict, decision-making, problem-solving

### P15 vs P10 Distinction:
- **P15 (Behavioral):** "Tell me about a time when..." → Focus: Past experience, STAR format
- **P10 (Executive Communication):** "How would you explain X to executives?" → Focus: Communication framework

### P15 vs P11 Distinction:
- **P15 (Behavioral):** "Tell me about a time when you influenced stakeholders" → Focus: Past experience, STAR
- **P11 (Stakeholder Alignment):** "How do you align stakeholders?" → Focus: Framework, process

### P15 vs P12 Distinction:
- **P15 (Behavioral):** "Tell me about a time when you fixed a broken process" → Focus: Past experience, STAR
- **P12 (Operational Excellence):** "How do you ensure system reliability?" → Focus: Framework, process

### Red Flags (NOT P15):
- "How would you design X?" → P13 (Product Design)
- "How would you increase revenue?" → P14 (Revenue Optimization)
- "How would you explain X?" → P10 (Executive Communication)

- **What:** "Tell me about a product you shipped" or "Product you're proud of" - behavioral product questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR)
- **Situation:** Context (What product/feature? When? Where?), Challenge (What was the context? What obstacles?)
- **Task:** Your role (What was your responsibility?), Goal (What were you trying to achieve?)
- **Action:** How you approached it (User research, Product decisions, Design choices, Launch strategy), Why you did it this way (Your reasoning, Tradeoffs considered)
- **Result:** Outcome (What happened? What was the result? Did you achieve your goal? What was the impact?), Learning (What did you learn? What would you do differently?)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Product you shipped: Situation (Product X, launched Y, context Z), Task (My role, goal), Action (User research, decisions, design, launch), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"
- "Feature you launched: Situation (Feature X, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (Approach, decisions), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q779: Explain a feature you've launched. (feature launch angle)
- Q154: Can you talk us through a product you've scoped and built? Include the goal and your specific role. (product case study angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR)`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When answering behavioral product questions, I use Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR).

**1️⃣ Situation** → What product/feature? When did this happen? Where were you? What was the challenge or problem? What was at stake?

**2️⃣ Task** → What was my responsibility? What was I asked to do? What was my goal? What constraints existed (time, resources, stakeholders)?

**3️⃣ Action** → I use 'I' statements, focus on my specific actions:
  - **User research:** What I learned about users
  - **Product decisions:** What I decided and why
  - **Design choices:** How I designed it
  - **Launch strategy:** How I launched it
  - **Why this approach:** Reasoning, alternatives considered

**4️⃣ Result** → What was the result? Did I achieve my goal? What was the impact? (Quantify when possible - metrics, user impact, business impact). What did I learn? What would I do differently?

**Key Principle:** Show product thinking, execution, and impact.
