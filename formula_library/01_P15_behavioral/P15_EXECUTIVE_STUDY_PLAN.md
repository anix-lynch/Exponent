## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15 (BEHAVIORAL) QUESTIONS

**Even when "behavioral" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Behavioral Keywords:
- "tell me about a time", "describe a time", "give me an example", "walk me through"
- "situation", "challenge", "problem", "failure", "mistake", "conflict"
- "how did you", "what did you do", "how would you handle"

### Implicit P15 Indicators:
- **Past experience questions:** "Tell me about a time when...", "Describe a situation where...", "Give me an example of..."
- **Behavioral questions:** "How do you handle...", "What's your approach to...", "How would you deal with..."
- **STAR format:** Questions asking for Situation, Task, Action, Result
- **Soft skills:** Leadership, collaboration, conflict, decision-making, problem-solving

### P15 vs P10 Distinction:
- **P15 (Behavioral):** "Tell me about a time when..." → Focus: Past experience, STAR format
- **P10 (Executive Communication):** "How would you explain X to executives?" → Focus: Communication framework

### P15 vs P11 Distinction:
- **P15 (Behavioral):** "Tell me about a time when you influenced stakeholders" → Focus: Past experience, STAR
- **P11 (Stakeholder Alignment):** "How do you align stakeholders?" → Focus: Framework, process

### P15 vs P12 Distinction:
- **P15 (Behavioral):** "Tell me about a time when you fixed a broken process" → Focus: Past experience, STAR
- **P12 (Operational Excellence):** "How do you ensure system reliability?" → Focus: Framework, process

### Red Flags (NOT P15):
- "How would you design X?" → P13 (Product Design)
- "How would you increase revenue?" → P14 (Revenue Optimization)
- "How would you explain X?" → P10 (Executive Communication)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Product Sense (Behavioral)
**Questions:** ~35 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Tell me about a product you shipped" or "Product you're proud of" - behavioral product questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR)
- **Situation:** Context (What product/feature? When? Where?), Challenge (What was the context? What obstacles?)
- **Task:** Your role (What was your responsibility?), Goal (What were you trying to achieve?)
- **Action:** How you approached it (User research, Product decisions, Design choices, Launch strategy), Why you did it this way (Your reasoning, Tradeoffs considered)
- **Result:** Outcome (What happened? What was the result? Did you achieve your goal? What was the impact?), Learning (What did you learn? What would you do differently?)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Product you shipped: Situation (Product X, launched Y, context Z), Task (My role, goal), Action (User research, decisions, design, launch), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"
- "Feature you launched: Situation (Feature X, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (Approach, decisions), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q779: Explain a feature you've launched. (feature launch angle)
- Q154: Can you talk us through a product you've scoped and built? Include the goal and your specific role. (product case study angle)
- Q1806: Share your experience around launching a product from 0 to 1. (0-to-1 launch angle)

- Q804: Explain how you took or would take a product from ideation to launch. (ideation to launch angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When answering behavioral product questions, I use Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR). Situation: I set the context - What product/feature? When did this happen? Where were you? What was the environment? What was the challenge or problem? What was at stake? Task: I define my role and goal - What was my responsibility? What was I asked to do? What was my goal? What constraints existed (time, resources, stakeholders)? Action: I describe what I did - I use 'I' statements, focus on my specific actions. What specific steps did I take? What decisions did I make? How did I approach the problem? I include: User research (What I learned about users), Product decisions (What I decided and why), Design choices (How I designed it), Launch strategy (How I launched it). Why did I choose this approach? What alternatives did I consider? What was my thought process? Result: I share the outcome - What was the result? Did I achieve my goal? What was the impact? (Quantify when possible - metrics, user impact, business impact). What did I learn? What would I do differently? How did this experience shape me? The key is showing product thinking, execution, and impact."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q779 (Explain a feature you've launched):** Focus on feature launch → "I'd describe launching [Feature X]: Situation (Feature: [specific feature], Context: [when/where], Challenge: [user problem, business need, constraints]), Task (My role: [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal: [solve user problem, achieve business goal], Constraints: [time, resources, stakeholders]), Action (User research: [What I learned about users, pain points, needs], Product decisions: [What I decided - features, prioritization, tradeoffs, Why - user value, business impact], Design choices: [How I designed it - UX, flow, edge cases], Launch strategy: [How I launched - phased rollout, metrics, communication], Why this approach: [Reasoning, alternatives considered]), Result (Outcome: [Feature launched, metrics improved], Impact: [Quantify - users impacted, metrics changed, business value], Learning: [What I learned, what I'd do differently]). I'd focus on showing product thinking, user-centric decisions, and measurable impact."

- **Q154 (Product you scoped and built):** Emphasize scoping and building → "I'd describe [Product X]: Situation (Product: [specific product], Context: [when/where/why], Challenge: [user problem, market opportunity, constraints]), Task (My role: [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal: [solve problem, achieve outcome], Constraints: [time, resources, team]), Action (Scoping: [How I scoped - user research, market analysis, requirements, prioritization], Building: [How I built - design, development, testing, iteration], Decisions: [Key decisions made, tradeoffs, reasoning], Approach: [My approach, collaboration, execution]), Result (Outcome: [Product launched, goals achieved], Impact: [Quantify - users, metrics, business value], Learning: [What I learned, improvements]).

New deadline?], Impact: [Quantify - delay impact, stakeholder impact, team impact], Learning: [What I learned, what I'd do differently - better planning, earlier communication, risk management]). I'd focus on ownership, problem-solving, and learning, not excuses."

- **Q1625 (Project 25% complete, 85% resources used):** Emphasize project recovery → "I'd describe joining a troubled project: Situation (Project: [specific project], Status: 25% complete, Resources: 85% used, Context: [when/where], Challenge: [Project is behind, resources almost gone, high risk of failure]), Task (My role: [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal: [Recover project, deliver value, minimize impact], Constraints: [Limited resources, time pressure, stakeholder expectations]), Action (How I approached it: [Immediate assessment - understand current state, root cause analysis, Stakeholder communication - transparent communication, reset expectations, Problem-solving - identify options, prioritize, make tradeoffs, Ownership - took responsibility, led recovery, Recovery plan - scope cuts, resource reallocation, timeline adjustments, risk mitigation], Why: [Reasoning, alternatives considered, tradeoffs]), Result (Outcome: [What happened - did we recover? Deliver value?], Impact: [Quantify - what was delivered, stakeholder satisfaction, team impact], Learning: [What I learned, what I'd do differently - better estimation, earlier intervention, risk management]).
