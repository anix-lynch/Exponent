## 📌 Sample: Behavioral Question

**Question:**
"Tell me about a time when you had to work with a difficult stakeholder."

**Answer Framework (STAR):**

1. **Situation**: Set the context. When did this happen? Where were you? What was the environment? What was the challenge or problem? What was at stake?

2. **Task**: Define your role and goal. What was your responsibility? What were you asked to do? What was your goal? What constraints existed (time, resources, stakeholders)?

3. **Action**: Describe what you did. Use "I" statements. What specific steps did you take? What decisions did you make? How did you approach the problem? Why did you choose this approach? What alternatives did you consider?

4. **Result**: Share the outcome. What was the result? Did you achieve your goal? What was the impact? What did you learn? What would you do differently? How did this experience shape you?

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **Be specific**: Use concrete examples, not hypotheticals
- **Use "I" statements**: Focus on your actions, not team actions
- **Show impact**: Quantify results when possible
- **Be honest**: Share both successes and failures (with learning)
- **Keep it concise**: 2-3 minutes per story
