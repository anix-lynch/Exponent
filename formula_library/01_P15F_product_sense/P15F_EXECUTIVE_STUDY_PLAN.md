# Executive Study Plan: P15F - Product Sense (Behavioral)
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, not per-question  
**Time:** 2-3 hours total across 3 passes  
**Source:** ~35 questions → 1 concept bucket → 1 high-impact bucket

**❤️ = "Hedgehog Answer"** - Your fallback narrative if you know nothing. Master these first!

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15F (PRODUCT SENSE - BEHAVIORAL) QUESTIONS

**Even when "product sense" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Product Keywords:
- "product you shipped", "feature you launched", "product you built", "product you're proud of"
- "product case study", "scoped and built", "ideation to launch", "0 to 1"

### Implicit P15F Indicators:
- **Product behavioral questions:** "Tell me about a product you shipped", "Feature you launched", "Product you scoped and built"
- **Product process questions:** "How do you take a product from idea to launch?", "Product from 0 to 1", "Ideation to launch"
- **Product thinking questions:** "What makes a good PM?", "How do you approach product development?"

### P15F vs P13 Distinction:
- **P15F (Product Sense - Behavioral):** "Tell me about a product you shipped" → Focus: Past experience, STAR format
- **P13 (Product Design):** "Design a product for X" → Focus: Framework, design process

### P15F vs P2 Distinction:
- **P15F (Product Sense - Behavioral):** "Tell me about a product you shipped" → Focus: Past experience, STAR
- **P2 (NSM + KPI):** "What metrics for this product?" → Focus: Metrics framework

### Red Flags (NOT P15F):
- "Design a product for X" → P13 (Product Design) - if framework-focused
- "What metrics for this product?" → P2 (NSM + KPI) - if metrics-focused

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Product Sense (Behavioral) Framework
**Questions:** ~35 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Tell me about a product you shipped" or "Product you're proud of" - behavioral product questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR)
- **Situation:** Context (What product/feature? When? Where?), Challenge (What was the context? What obstacles? What was at stake?)
- **Task:** Your role (What was your responsibility? What was I asked to do?), Goal (What were you trying to achieve? What constraints existed - time, resources, stakeholders?)
- **Action:** User research (What I learned about users), Product decisions (What I decided and why), Design choices (How I designed it), Launch strategy (How I launched it), Why this approach (Reasoning, alternatives considered)
- **Result:** Outcome (What happened? What was the result? Did I achieve my goal?), Impact (What was the impact? Quantify when possible - metrics, user impact, business impact), Learning (What did I learn? What would I do differently?)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Product you shipped: Situation (Product X, launched Y, context Z), Task (My role, goal), Action (User research, decisions, design, launch), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"
- "Feature you launched: Situation (Feature X, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (Approach, decisions), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q779: Explain a feature you've launched. (feature launch angle)
- Q154: Can you talk us through a product you've scoped and built? Include the goal and your specific role. (product case study angle)
- Q1806: Share your experience around launching a product from 0 to 1. (0-to-1 launch angle)
- Q1866: Tell me about a product or feature you shipped. (product shipping angle)
- Q804: Explain how you took or would take a product from ideation to launch. (ideation to launch angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR)`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When answering behavioral product questions, I use Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR).

**1️⃣ Situation** → What product/feature? When did this happen? Where were you? What was the challenge or problem? What was at stake?

**2️⃣ Task** → What was my responsibility? What was I asked to do? What was my goal? What constraints existed (time, resources, stakeholders)?

**3️⃣ Action** → I use 'I' statements, focus on my specific actions:
  - **User research:** What I learned about users
  - **Product decisions:** What I decided and why
  - **Design choices:** How I designed it
  - **Launch strategy:** How I launched it
  - **Why this approach:** Reasoning, alternatives considered

**4️⃣ Result** → What was the result? Did I achieve my goal? What was the impact? (Quantify when possible - metrics, user impact, business impact). What did I learn? What would I do differently?

**Key Principle:** Show product thinking, execution, and impact.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q779 (Explain a feature you've launched):** Focus on feature launch
  - "Situation: Feature [specific feature], Context [when/where], Challenge [user problem, business need, constraints]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [solve user problem, achieve business goal], Constraints [time, resources, stakeholders]"
  - "Action: User research [what I learned about users, pain points, needs], Product decisions [what I decided - features, prioritization, tradeoffs, Why - user value, business impact], Design choices [how I designed it - UX, flow, edge cases], Launch strategy [how I launched - phased rollout, metrics, communication], Why this approach [reasoning, alternatives considered]"
  - "Result: Outcome [feature launched, metrics improved], Impact [quantify - users impacted, metrics changed, business value], Learning [what I learned, what I'd do differently]"
  - "Focus on showing product thinking, user-centric decisions, and measurable impact"

- **Q154 (Product you scoped and built):** Emphasize scoping and building
  - "Situation: Product [specific product], Context [when/where/why], Challenge [user problem, market opportunity, constraints]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [solve problem, achieve outcome], Constraints [time, resources, team]"
  - "Action: Scoping [how I scoped - user research, market analysis, requirements, prioritization], Building [how I built - design, development, testing, iteration], Decisions [key decisions made, tradeoffs, reasoning], Approach [my approach, collaboration, execution]"
  - "Result: Outcome [product launched, goals achieved], Impact [quantify - users, metrics, business value], Learning [what I learned, improvements]"
  - "Emphasize the scoping process, key decisions, and execution"

## 🚦 TRAFFIC LIGHT PRIORITIZATION

### 🟢 GREEN (Master - Can explain to non-technical exec)
1. **Product Sense (Behavioral) Framework** → Study Bucket 1, practice 5 questions

---

## ✅ EXECUTIVE CHECKLIST

Before your interview, you should be able to:

- [ ] Walk through product sense STAR framework in 2 minutes
- [ ] Show product thinking (user-centric, business-aware decisions)
- [ ] Demonstrate execution (how you shipped, not just ideated)
- [ ] Show impact (what was the user/business impact?)
- [ ] Reflect on process (how you approach product development)

## 🎯 SUCCESS METRICS

**You're ready when:**
- You can explain the product sense framework to a non-technical person in 2 minutes
- You have 1 reusable narrative that you can adapt
- You've practiced 5 representative questions
- You focus on **Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR) framework**, not memorizing answers

**Remember:** P15F is about product sense through past actions. The framework: Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR). Key principles: Show product thinking, execution, and impact. Not product cases, not metrics - your actual experience.
