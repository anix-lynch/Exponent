## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Subscription Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Subscription products are about **retention and lifetime value**. Metrics must capture both acquisition (getting subscribers) and retention (keeping them) to maximize LTV.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Recurring revenue: predictable, scalable
- Churn is critical: losing subscribers hurts more than gaining new ones
- Engagement drives retention: active users stay longer
- LTV/CAC ratio: must be > 3:1 to be profitable

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Subscription Products
**Questions:** ~4 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** Retention (D7, D30, M3), LTV (Lifetime Value), MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- **Key Insight:** Retention is usually the NSM - it predicts LTV and MRR growth
- **Input KPIs:** Engagement (content consumption, feature usage), Acquisition (CAC, conversion), Revenue (MRR, ARPU, expansion)
- **Leading Indicators:** First-week engagement, content completion rate, feature adoption
- **Guardrails:** Churn rate, content quality, price sensitivity

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Netflix NSM: M3 Retention (users who stay 3 months) - predicts LTV"
- "Spotify NSM: D30 Retention (users who stay 30 days) - measures engagement"
- "SaaS NSM: MRR Growth - measures business health"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Netflix/Spotify/SaaS product
- What metrics would you track for a subscription service?
- How would you measure subscription success?
- What are the key metrics for retention?
- How would you define success for a content subscription?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For subscription products, the NSM is typically Retention (D7, D30, or M3) - it predicts LTV and MRR growth. Input KPIs: engagement (content consumption, feature usage, session frequency), acquisition (CAC, conversion rate, trial-to-paid conversion), and revenue (MRR growth, ARPU, expansion revenue). Leading indicators: first-week engagement, content completion rate, feature adoption. Guardrails: churn rate (must be low), content quality (must be high), and price sensitivity (must be acceptable)."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for Netflix:** Focus on content → "For Netflix, NSM: M3 Retention (users who stay 3 months). Input KPIs: engagement (watch time, content completion), acquisition (sign-up rate, trial conversion), revenue (MRR, ARPU). Leading indicators: first-week watch time, content discovery rate. Guardrails: churn rate, content quality, price sensitivity."

- **Measure subscription success:** Emphasize retention → "Subscription success is measured by retention (D7, D30, M3), LTV (lifetime value), and MRR growth. Input KPIs: engagement depth, acquisition efficiency (CAC), revenue per user (ARPU). Leading indicators: first-week engagement, feature adoption. Guardrails: churn rate, content quality, unit economics (LTV/CAC > 3:1)."

### BUCKET 2: Retention & Churn Metrics
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Retention Metrics:** D7, D30, M3 retention, cohort retention curves
- **Churn Metrics:** Churn rate, revenue churn, voluntary vs involuntary churn
- **Key Insight:** Retention predicts LTV - small improvements in retention = big LTV gains
- **Measurement:** Cohort retention, churn rate, LTV

**Concrete Examples:**
- "D30 retention: % of users who stay 30 days - measures early engagement"
- "Churn rate: % of subscribers who cancel monthly - target < 5%"
- "LTV: average revenue per customer over lifetime - target > 3× CAC"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure retention?
- What metrics indicate good retention?
- How would you reduce churn?
- What's the relationship between retention and LTV?
- How do you measure cohort retention?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For retention and churn, I measure cohort retention (D7, D30, M3), churn rate (% who cancel monthly, target < 5%), and LTV (lifetime value, target > 3× CAC). Input KPIs: engagement depth (content consumption, feature usage), acquisition quality (trial conversion, sign-up source), revenue per user (ARPU). Leading indicators: first-week engagement, content completion rate, feature adoption. Guardrails: churn rate (must be low), content quality (must be high), price sensitivity (must be acceptable). Small improvements in retention = big LTV gains."

### BUCKET 3: Engagement & Content Metrics
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Engagement Metrics:** Content consumption, feature usage, session frequency, time spent
- **Content Metrics:** Content completion rate, content discovery, content quality score
- **Key Insight:** Engagement drives retention - active users stay longer
- **Measurement:** Weekly active users, content hours consumed, feature adoption rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Content consumption: hours watched/read/listened - measures engagement depth"
- "Feature adoption: % of users using key features - measures value realization"
- "Session frequency: sessions per week - measures habit formation"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure engagement?
- What metrics indicate content quality?
- How would you improve content consumption?
- What's the relationship between engagement and retention?
- How do you measure feature adoption?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For engagement and content, I measure content consumption (hours watched/read/listened), feature adoption (% using key features), and session frequency (sessions per week). Input KPIs: content completion rate, content discovery rate, feature usage rate. Leading indicators: first-week engagement, time-to-first-value, content completion rate. Guardrails: content quality (must be high), feature reliability (must work), user satisfaction (must be positive). Engagement drives retention - active users stay longer."

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2B4 (SUBSCRIPTION METRICS) QUESTIONS

**Look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Keywords:
- "Netflix", "Spotify", "subscription", "churn", "retention", "LTV", "MRR", "ARR"
- "recurring revenue", "monthly subscription", "trial", "renewal"

### Implicit Indicators:
- **Retention questions:** "how to measure retention?", "improve retention", "reduce churn"
- **Revenue questions:** "MRR", "ARR", "recurring revenue", "subscription revenue"
- **Engagement questions:** "content consumption", "watch time", "listen time", "feature usage"
- **Acquisition:** "trial conversion", "sign-up to paid", "CAC", "LTV/CAC"

### P2B4 vs Other Patterns:
- **P2B4 (Subscription):** "What metrics for Netflix?" → Focus: Retention, LTV, engagement
- **P2 (General NSM):** "What metrics for product?" → Focus: Universal NSM framework
- **P4 (Cohort):** "Cohort retention declined" → Focus: Compare cohorts over time
