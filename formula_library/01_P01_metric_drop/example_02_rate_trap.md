2 (rate vs denominator trap)

**Prompt:** "Conversion rate dropped from 10% to 7%."

```text
1) Clarify
- Conversion = orders / sessions (rate)
- Is orders down, or sessions up (bad traffic), or both?

2) Data Check
- Did session tracking change? bots? new channel sending low-intent traffic?

3) Segment
- By channel: new paid campaign added; converts at 1%
- By landing page: new landing page converts poorly
=> Hot spot = new campaign + landing page

4) Hypotheses
- Campaign targeting wrong audience
- Landing page broken / slow
- Pricing mismatch vs ad promise

5) Validate
- Compare bounce, time-to-interact, funnel step drop on that landing page
- Ad group breakdown

6) Action
- Pause campaign or fix landing page
- Add guardrails: quality metrics per channel (bounce, add-to-cart)
