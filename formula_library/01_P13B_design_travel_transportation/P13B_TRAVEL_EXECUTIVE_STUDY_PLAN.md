**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When designing a travel platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics. First, I identify Users: Who are the users? (Travelers, Commuters, Transportation providers), What are their needs? (Trip planning, Navigation, Transportation options). Then I define Jobs: What jobs do users need done? (Plan trips, Navigate routes, Book transportation, Find parking), Prioritize by Frequency and Urgency. Next, I design Core Loop: What is the engagement loop? (Plan trip → Navigate/use service → Complete trip → Return for next trip), How does it drive retention? (Regular commutes, Trip planning habits). I design Key Features: Core features (Maps/navigation, Route planning, Transportation booking, Parking), Supporting features (Search, Reviews, Real-time updates, Offline mode). I consider Tradeoffs: Accuracy vs speed, Real-time vs offline, Features vs simplicity. Finally, I define Success Metrics: Usage metrics (Trips planned, Navigation sessions, Bookings), Retention metrics (Daily/weekly active users, Repeat usage). The key is designing a platform that makes trip planning and navigation easy and reliable."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q449 (Design product for travelers at airports):** Focus on airport travel → "To design a product for travelers at airports, I'd: Users (Travelers (passengers), Airport staff, Airlines), Needs (Navigate airport, Find gates/services, Track flights, Reduce stress), Jobs (Find gate, Check flight status, Find services (food, shops, lounges), Navigate terminal, Track baggage), Core Loop (Arrive at airport → Open app → Get directions → Use services → Complete journey → Return for next trip), Key Features (Airport maps (terminal layout, gate locations), Flight tracking (real-time status, gate changes), Navigation (indoor navigation, directions), Services (food, shops, lounges, restrooms), Notifications (flight updates, gate changes), Offline mode (works without internet)), Tradeoffs (Accuracy vs speed - prioritize accuracy, Real-time vs offline - support both, Features vs simplicity - keep simple), Success Metrics (Usage: Airport sessions, navigation usage, service discovery | Retention: Repeat usage, user satisfaction, completion rate). I'd prioritize indoor navigation and flight tracking as core features."

- **Q1310 (Design parking features on Google Maps):** Emphasize parking feature → "To design parking features on Google Maps, I'd: Users (Drivers, Commuters, City planners), Needs (Find parking, Save time, Reduce stress, Avoid tickets), Jobs (Find available parking, Reserve parking, Navigate to parking, Pay for parking), Core Loop (Search destination → See parking options → Select parking → Navigate → Park → Return for next trip), Key Features (Parking search (near destination, availability), Parking information (price, hours, restrictions), Navigation (directions to parking), Reservation (book in advance), Payment (pay through app), Real-time updates (availability, pricing)), Tradeoffs (Accuracy vs speed - need real-time accuracy, Features vs simplicity - keep simple, Free vs paid - support both), Success Metrics (Usage: Parking searches, reservations, navigation to parking | Retention: Repeat usage, user satisfaction, completion rate).
