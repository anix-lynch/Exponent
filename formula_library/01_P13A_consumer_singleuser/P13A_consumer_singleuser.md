# P13A - Consumer / Single-User Products

**Formula:** `User Context → Pain Points → Core Design → Tradeoffs → Risks`

**Intent:** Physical products, standalone apps, accessibility products. Focus on user needs, simplicity, and usability.

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
Consumer / Single-User Product Design
│
├─ 1) User Context
│   ├─ Who is the user?
│   │   ├─ Demographics
│   │   ├─ Physical/mental capabilities
│   │   └─ Usage environment
│   │
│   └─ What is their current experience?
│       ├─ Existing solutions
│       └─ Pain points
│
├─ 2) Pain Points
│   ├─ What problems need solving?
│   │   ├─ Functional problems
│   │   ├─ Usability issues
│   │   └─ Accessibility barriers
│   │
│   └─ Prioritize pain points
│       ├─ Frequency
│       └─ Severity
│
├─ 3) Core Design
│   ├─ Key features
│   │   ├─ Must-have functionality
│   │   ├─ Usability improvements
│   │   └─ Accessibility features
│   │
│   └─ Design principles
│       ├─ Simplicity
│       ├─ Safety
│       └─ Durability
│
├─ 4) Tradeoffs
│   ├─ Cost vs quality
│   ├─ Features vs simplicity
│   └─ Customization vs standardization
│
└─ 5) Risks
    ├─ Safety risks
    ├─ Adoption barriers
    └─ Manufacturing constraints
