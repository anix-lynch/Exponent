## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why SaaS/Enterprise Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** SaaS/Enterprise products are about **recurring revenue and customer success**. Metrics must capture both acquisition (new customers) and expansion (existing customers) to maximize ARR and NRR.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Recurring revenue: ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Customer success: Product adoption drives retention and expansion
- Sales cycles: Longer, relationship-based
- Expansion revenue: Critical for growth (upsells, cross-sells)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for SaaS/Enterprise Products
**Questions:** ~4 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), NRR (Net Revenue Retention), Product Adoption Score
- **Key Insight:** NRR is often the NSM - it measures expansion minus churn (target > 100%)
- **Input KPIs:** Revenue (new customers, expansion, renewals), Product Adoption (feature usage, seat utilization), Customer Health (engagement, support tickets, NPS)
- **Leading Indicators:** Time to value, Feature adoption rate, Expansion signal strength
- **Guardrails:** Churn rate, CAC payback period, Customer concentration risk

**Concrete Examples:**
- "SaaS NSM: NRR (Net Revenue Retention) - expansion revenue minus churn, target > 100%"
- "Enterprise NSM: ARR Growth - new customers + expansion - churn"
- "Product-led SaaS NSM: Product Adoption Score - feature usage + seat utilization"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for a SaaS product
- What metrics would you track for enterprise software?
- How would you measure SaaS success?
- What are the key metrics for B2B software?
- How would you define success for a product-led SaaS?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For SaaS/Enterprise products, the NSM is typically NRR (Net Revenue Retention) - expansion revenue minus churn, target > 100%. This captures both retention and growth from existing customers. Input KPIs: revenue (new customer acquisition, expansion revenue, contract renewals), product adoption (feature usage, seat utilization, integration adoption), and customer health (product engagement, support ticket volume, customer satisfaction/NPS). Leading indicators: time to value (how quickly customers see value), feature adoption rate, expansion signal strength. Guardrails: churn rate (must be low), CAC payback period (must be < 12 months), and customer concentration risk (no single customer > 20% of revenue)."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for SaaS product:** Focus on recurring revenue → "For SaaS, NSM: NRR (Net Revenue Retention) - expansion minus churn, target > 100%. Input KPIs: new customer ARR, expansion ARR, churn ARR. Leading indicators: time to value, feature adoption, expansion signals. Guardrails: churn rate, CAC payback, customer concentration."

- **Measure enterprise software success:** Emphasize enterprise context → "For enterprise software, NSM: ARR Growth (new + expansion - churn). Input KPIs: new customer acquisition, expansion revenue, contract renewals, product adoption (seat utilization, feature usage). Leading indicators: time to value, feature adoption rate. Guardrails: churn rate, customer satisfaction, contract renewal rate."

### BUCKET 2: Revenue Metrics (ARR, NRR, MRR)
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **ARR/MRR:** Annual/Monthly Recurring Revenue - predictable revenue base
- **NRR:** Net Revenue Retention = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting ARR
- **Key Insight:** NRR > 100% means growing from existing customers (best growth)
- **Measurement:** ARR growth rate, NRR by cohort, expansion rate, churn rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue - predictable revenue base"
- "NRR: Net Revenue Retention - expansion minus churn, target > 100%"
- "Expansion rate: % of customers who increase spend - drives NRR"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure ARR growth?
- What is NRR and why does it matter?
- How would you improve NRR?
- What's the relationship between ARR and NRR?
- How do you measure expansion revenue?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For revenue metrics, I measure ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) as the base, NRR (Net Revenue Retention) as the growth engine, and expansion rate as the driver. NRR = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting ARR, target > 100%. Input KPIs: new customer ARR, expansion ARR (upsells, cross-sells), churn ARR. Leading indicators: expansion signal strength (feature usage, seat growth), time to expansion. Guardrails: churn rate (must be low), CAC payback (must be < 12 months), customer concentration (must be diversified). NRR > 100% means growing from existing customers, which is the best type of growth."

### BUCKET 3: Product Adoption & Customer Health
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Adoption Metrics:** Feature usage, seat utilization, integration adoption, time to value
- **Health Metrics:** Product engagement, support ticket volume, customer satisfaction (NPS)
- **Key Insight:** Adoption drives retention and expansion - measure depth, not just breadth
- **Measurement:** Feature adoption rate, seat utilization %, time to first value, NPS

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Feature adoption: % of customers using key features - measures value realization"
- "Seat utilization: % of seats used - measures product penetration"
- "Time to value: days to first value - measures onboarding success"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure product adoption?
- What metrics indicate customer health?
- How would you improve time to value?
- What's the relationship between adoption and retention?
- How do you measure customer success?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For product adoption and customer health, I measure feature adoption (% using key features), seat utilization (% of seats used), and time to value (days to first value). Input KPIs: product engagement (sessions, features used), support ticket volume (lower is better), customer satisfaction (NPS). Leading indicators: first-feature-use rate, time-to-first-value, expansion signal strength. Guardrails: adoption depth (must use core features), support burden (must be manageable), customer satisfaction (must be positive). Adoption drives retention and expansion - customers who adopt deeply stay longer and expand more."

### BUCKET 4: Acquisition & Unit Economics
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Acquisition Metrics:** CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), CAC payback period, LTV/CAC ratio
- **Unit Economics:** LTV (Lifetime Value), CAC, payback period, gross margin
- **Key Insight:** LTV/CAC > 3:1 is healthy, payback < 12 months is good
- **Measurement:** CAC by channel, LTV by cohort, payback period, gross margin

**Concrete Examples:**
- "CAC: Customer Acquisition Cost - cost to acquire one customer"
- "LTV/CAC ratio: Lifetime Value / CAC - target > 3:1"
- "Payback period: months to recover CAC - target < 12 months"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure CAC?
- What is LTV/CAC ratio and why does it matter?
- How would you improve unit economics?
- What's the relationship between CAC and LTV?
- How do you measure payback period?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For acquisition and unit economics, I measure CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), LTV (Lifetime Value), and payback period. LTV/CAC ratio target > 3:1, payback period target < 12 months. Input KPIs: CAC by channel, LTV by cohort, gross margin, churn rate. Leading indicators: conversion rate by channel, time to value, expansion signals. Guardrails: CAC payback (must be < 12 months), LTV/CAC (must be > 3:1), gross margin (must be > 70%). Healthy unit economics enable sustainable growth."

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2B5 (SAAS/ENTERPRISE METRICS) QUESTIONS

**Look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Keywords:
- "SaaS", "enterprise", "B2B", "ARR", "NRR", "MRR", "CAC", "LTV", "churn"
- "recurring revenue", "customer success", "product adoption", "seat utilization"

### Implicit Indicators:
- **Revenue questions:** "ARR growth", "NRR", "expansion revenue", "renewal rate"
- **Adoption questions:** "product adoption", "feature usage", "seat utilization", "time to value"
- **Customer health:** "customer success", "NPS", "support tickets", "customer satisfaction"
- **Unit economics:** "CAC", "LTV", "payback period", "LTV/CAC ratio"

### P2B5 vs Other Patterns:
- **P2B5 (SaaS/Enterprise):** "What metrics for SaaS product?" → Focus: NRR, ARR, adoption
- **P2 (General NSM):** "What metrics for product?" → Focus: Universal NSM framework
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "ARR growth down" → Focus: Diagnose why metric dropped
