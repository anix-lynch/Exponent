## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why SaaS/Enterprise Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** SaaS/Enterprise products are about **recurring revenue and customer success**. Metrics must capture both acquisition (new customers) and expansion (existing customers) to maximize ARR and NRR.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Recurring revenue: ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), MRR (Monthly Recurring Revenue)
- Customer success: Product adoption drives retention and expansion
- Sales cycles: Longer, relationship-based
- Expansion revenue: Critical for growth (upsells, cross-sells)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for SaaS/Enterprise Products
**Questions:** ~4 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue), NRR (Net Revenue Retention), Product Adoption Score
- **Key Insight:** NRR is often the NSM - it measures expansion minus churn (target > 100%)
- **Input KPIs:** Revenue (new customers, expansion, renewals), Product Adoption (feature usage, seat utilization), Customer Health (engagement, support tickets, NPS)
- **Leading Indicators:** Time to value, Feature adoption rate, Expansion signal strength
- **Guardrails:** Churn rate, CAC payback period, Customer concentration risk

**Concrete Examples:**
- "SaaS NSM: NRR (Net Revenue Retention) - expansion revenue minus churn, target > 100%"
- "Enterprise NSM: ARR Growth - new customers + expansion - churn"
- "Product-led SaaS NSM: Product Adoption Score - feature usage + seat utilization"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for a SaaS product
- What metrics would you track for enterprise software?
- How would you measure SaaS success?
- What are the key metrics for B2B software?
- How would you define success for a product-led SaaS?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `NSM (NRR) → Revenue KPIs → Product Adoption → Customer Health → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For SaaS/Enterprise products, the NSM is typically NRR (Net Revenue Retention) - expansion revenue minus churn, target > 100%.

**1️⃣ NSM (NRR)** → Captures both retention and growth from existing customers (target > 100%).

**2️⃣ Revenue KPIs** → New customer acquisition, expansion revenue, contract renewals.

**3️⃣ Product Adoption** → Feature usage, seat utilization, integration adoption.

**4️⃣ Customer Health** → Product engagement, support ticket volume, customer satisfaction/NPS.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Churn rate (must be low), CAC payback period (must be < 12 months), customer concentration risk (no single customer > 20% of revenue).

**Key Principle:** NRR > 100% means growing from existing customers - best type of growth.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for SaaS product:** Focus on recurring revenue
  - "NSM: NRR (Net Revenue Retention) - expansion minus churn, target > 100%"
  - "Input KPIs: new customer ARR, expansion ARR, churn ARR"
  - "Leading indicators: time to value, feature adoption, expansion signals"
  - "Guardrails: churn rate, CAC payback, customer concentration"

- **Measure enterprise software success:** Emphasize enterprise context
  - "NSM: ARR Growth (new + expansion - churn)"
  - "Input KPIs: new customer acquisition, expansion revenue, contract renewals, product adoption (seat utilization, feature usage)"
  - "Leading indicators: time to value, feature adoption rate"
  - "Guardrails: churn rate, customer satisfaction, contract renewal rate"

### BUCKET 2: Revenue Metrics (ARR, NRR, MRR)
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **ARR/MRR:** Annual/Monthly Recurring Revenue - predictable revenue base
- **NRR:** Net Revenue Retention = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting ARR
- **Key Insight:** NRR > 100% means growing from existing customers (best growth)
- **Measurement:** ARR growth rate, NRR by cohort, expansion rate, churn rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "ARR: Annual Recurring Revenue - predictable revenue base"
- "NRR: Net Revenue Retention - expansion minus churn, target > 100%"
- "Expansion rate: % of customers who increase spend - drives NRR"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure ARR growth?
- What is NRR and why does it matter?
- How would you improve NRR?
- What's the relationship between ARR and NRR?
- How do you measure expansion revenue?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `ARR → NRR → Expansion Rate → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For revenue metrics, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ ARR** → Annual Recurring Revenue - predictable revenue base.

**2️⃣ NRR** → Net Revenue Retention = (Starting ARR + Expansion - Churn) / Starting ARR (target > 100%).

**3️⃣ Expansion Rate** → % of customers who increase spend - drives NRR.

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → New customer ARR, expansion ARR (upsells, cross-sells), churn ARR.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Churn rate (must be low), CAC payback (must be < 12 months), customer concentration (must be diversified).

**Key Principle:** NRR > 100% means growing from existing customers - best type of growth.

### BUCKET 3: Product Adoption & Customer Health
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Adoption Metrics:** Feature usage, seat utilization, integration adoption, time to value
- **Health Metrics:** Product engagement, support ticket volume, customer satisfaction (NPS)
- **Key Insight:** Adoption drives retention and expansion - measure depth, not just breadth
- **Measurement:** Feature adoption rate, seat utilization %, time to first value, NPS

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Feature adoption: % of customers using key features - measures value realization"
- "Seat utilization: % of seats used - measures product penetration"
- "Time to value: days to first value - measures onboarding success"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure product adoption?
- What metrics indicate customer health?
- How would you improve time to value?
- What's the relationship between adoption and retention?
- How do you measure customer success?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Feature Adoption → Seat Utilization → Time to Value → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For product adoption and customer health, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ Feature Adoption** → % using key features.

**2️⃣ Seat Utilization** → % of seats used.

**3️⃣ Time to Value** → Days to first value.

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Product engagement (sessions, features used), support ticket volume (lower is better), customer satisfaction (NPS).

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Adoption depth (must use core features), support burden (must be manageable), customer satisfaction (must be positive).

**Key Principle:** Adoption drives retention and expansion - customers who adopt deeply stay longer and expand more.

**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Acquisition Metrics:** CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost), CAC payback period, LTV/CAC ratio
- **Unit Economics:** LTV (Lifetime Value), CAC, payback period, gross margin
- **Key Insight:** LTV/CAC > 3:1 is healthy, payback < 12 months is good
- **Measurement:** CAC by channel, LTV by cohort, payback period, gross margin

**Concrete Examples:**
- "CAC: Customer Acquisition Cost - cost to acquire one customer"
- "LTV/CAC ratio: Lifetime Value / CAC - target > 3:1"
- "Payback period: months to recover CAC - target < 12 months"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure CAC?
- What is LTV/CAC ratio and why does it matter?
- How would you improve unit economics?
- What's the relationship between CAC and LTV?
- How do you measure payback period?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `CAC → LTV → Payback Period → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For acquisition and unit economics, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ CAC** → Customer Acquisition Cost.

**2️⃣ LTV** → Lifetime Value.

**3️⃣ Payback Period** → Months to recover CAC (target < 12 months).

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → CAC by channel, LTV by cohort, gross margin, churn rate.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → CAC payback (must be < 12 months), LTV/CAC (must be > 3:1), gross margin (must be > 70%).

**Key Principle:** Healthy unit economics enable sustainable growth.
