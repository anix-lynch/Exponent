# L10 - Process Optimization

**Formula:** `Map Workflow → Identify Bottlenecks → Optimize → Measure`

**Intent:** Optimize workflows, processes, and systems. Focus on identifying bottlenecks and improving efficiency.

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
Process Optimization
│
├─ 1) Map Workflow
│   ├─ Document current process
│   │   ├─ All steps (from start to finish)
│   │   ├─ Sequence (order of operations)
│   │   ├─ Dependencies (between steps)
│   │   └─ Stakeholders (who is involved)
│   │
│   └─ Measure current state
│       ├─ Time (how long each step takes)
│       ├─ Cycle time (total time)
│       └─ Handoffs (where work transfers)
│
├─ 2) Identify Bottlenecks
│   ├─ Time analysis
│   │   ├─ Which step takes longest?
│   │   └─ Where is work waiting?
│   │
│   ├─ Resource constraints
│   │   ├─ Limited capacity
│   │   ├─ Single-threaded steps
│   │   └─ Manual processes
│   │
│   └─ Pain points
│       ├─ Queues
│       ├─ Rework
│       └─ Dependencies
│
├─ 3) Optimize
│   ├─ Increase capacity
│   │   ├─ Add resources
│   │   └─ Parallel processing
│   │
│   ├─ Reduce demand
│   │   ├─ Batch processing
│   │   └─ Off-peak scheduling
│   │
│   ├─ Optimize flow
│   │   ├─ Reduce wait time
│   │   └─ Improve routing
│   │
│   └─ Eliminate waste
│       ├─ Remove unnecessary steps
│       └─ Streamline
│
└─ 4) Measure
    ├─ Before metrics
    │   ├─ Cycle time
    │   ├─ Throughput
    │   └─ Error rate
    │
    ├─ After metrics
    │   ├─ Improved cycle time
    │   ├─ Increased throughput
    │   └─ Reduced error rate
    │
    └─ Continuous monitoring
        ├─ Track over time
        ├─ Identify new bottlenecks
        └─ Iterate
```

## 📌 Sample Questions

- "How would you optimize X process?"
- "What's the bottleneck in this workflow?"
- "How would you reduce wait time?"
- "Design a workflow for X"

## 🎯 Key Principles

- **Map first**: Understand current state before optimizing
- **Focus on bottlenecks**: Highest time impact first
- **Measure impact**: Track before/after metrics
- **Iterate**: Continuous improvement
