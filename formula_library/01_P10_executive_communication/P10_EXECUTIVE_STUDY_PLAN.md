## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P10 (EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "executive" or "communication" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Communication Keywords:
- "explain", "present", "pitch", "communicate", "describe", "tell"
- "to a non-technical audience", "to leadership", "to executives", "to your grandmother"
- "how would you explain", "how would you present", "how would you convince"

### Implicit P10 Indicators:
- **Explanation questions:** "explain X to Y", "how would you explain", "describe X"
- **Presentation questions:** "how would you present", "prepare a presentation", "pitch to"
- **Simplification questions:** "explain to a 5-year-old", "explain to your grandmother", "simplify"
- **Executive questions:** "to leadership", "to executives", "to senior management", "to CEO"
- **Insight communication:** "how would you convey insights", "share results", "communicate findings"

### P10 vs P11 Distinction:
- **P10 (Executive Communication):** "How would you explain X to executives?" → Focus: COMMUNICATE clearly (Context → Insight → Recommendation → Next Steps)
- **P11 (Stakeholder Alignment):** "How do you align stakeholders?" → Focus: ALIGN stakeholders (Understand Incentives → Address Concerns → Build Coalition)

### P10 vs P1 Distinction:
- **P10 (Executive Communication):** "How would you explain revenue drop to leadership?" → Focus: COMMUNICATE the explanation
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Revenue dropped 25%" → Focus: DIAGNOSE why it dropped

### Red Flags (NOT P10):
- "How do you align stakeholders?" → P11 (Stakeholder Alignment)
- "Revenue dropped 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)
- "How would you test X?" → P8 (Experiment Design)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Executive Presentations & Recommendations
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "How would you present to CEO?" or "Prepare presentation for executives" - core executive communication framework
- **Framework:** Context → Insight → Recommendation → Next Steps
- **Context (WHY):** One-sentence situation (what changed, why now, what's at stake), Business goal (revenue/growth/risk/efficiency), Decision owner/timeline
- **Insight (WHAT):** 2-3 facts only (data signal, user/market signal, constraint/risk), Translate data → meaning ("This means...", "The implication is...")
- **Recommendation (WHAT to do):** Clear decision (Do X, Do X over Y, Do X now), Why this is right (upside, risk acknowledged, why alternatives are worse)
- **Next Steps (HOW):** Immediate actions (30-60-90 days), Owner(s), Success metric, Decision checkpoints/update cadence

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Present to CEO: Context (revenue plateaued, need new stream), Insight (ads increase revenue 12-18% in similar products), Recommendation (introduce limited ads with guardrails), Next Steps (90-day pilot, weekly readout)"
- "Explain revenue drop: Context (sudden 25% drop, urgent), Insight (iOS revenue dropped 30%, Android stable), Recommendation (investigate iOS, rollback if needed), Next Steps (immediate investigation, daily updates)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1528: How would you prepare a presentation for the CEO, within two weeks, on Microsoft Shifts' current performance and potential improvements? (CEO presentation angle)
- Q1349: How would you explain a sudden drop in revenue to leadership? (revenue explanation angle)
- Q1147: How do you sell an idea to senior management, and what would be included in the slide content? (idea pitching angle)
- Q1528: How would you prepare a presentation for the CEO, within two weeks, on Microsoft Shifts' current performance and potential improvements? (performance review angle)
- Q1530: How would you prepare for and conduct a final presentation for a client? (client presentation angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Context → Insight → Recommendation → Next Steps`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When presenting to executives, I use the Context → Insight → Recommendation → Next Steps framework.

**1️⃣ Context (WHY)** → One-sentence situation (what changed, why now, what's at stake), Business goal (revenue/growth/risk/efficiency), Decision owner/timeline.

**2️⃣ Insight (WHAT)** → 2-3 key facts only (data signal, user/market signal, constraint/risk), Translate data to meaning ("This means...", "The implication is...").

**3️⃣ Recommendation (WHAT to do)** → Clear decision (Do X, Do X over Y, Do X now), Why this is right (upside, risk acknowledged, why alternatives are worse).

**4️⃣ Next Steps (HOW)** → Immediate actions (30-60-90 days), Owner(s), Success metric, Decision checkpoints/update cadence.

**Key Principle:** Executives want confidence, clarity, and accountability - not analysis dumps.

  - "Context: Shifts launched 6 months ago, need to assess performance and plan improvements, decision needed on investment"
  - "Insight: 3 key facts - adoption is 40% of target, engagement is high among adopters, cost per user is 20% above budget → this means product-market fit exists but acquisition is slow"
  - "Recommendation: Double down on high-engagement segments, optimize acquisition channels, reduce cost per user → this works because we have proof of value, just need to scale efficiently"
  - "Next Steps: 30 days (segment analysis and channel optimization), 60 days (test new acquisition channels), 90 days (review and decide on expansion) - weekly updates to CEO"

- **Q1349 (Explain revenue drop to leadership):** Emphasize crisis communication
  - "Context: Revenue dropped 25% last week, urgent decision needed, risk to Q4 targets"
  - "Insight: 3 facts - iOS revenue dropped 30%, Android stable, web dropped 15% → this means iOS-specific issue, not universal problem"
  - "Recommendation: Immediate - investigate iOS issue (likely payment processing), rollback recent iOS changes if needed, communicate to iOS users → this works because we isolate the problem and protect Android/web revenue"
  - "Next Steps: Today (iOS investigation), Tomorrow (decision on rollback), This week (fix and monitor) - daily updates to leadership"

- **Q1147 (Sell idea to senior management):** Focus on idea pitching
  - "Context: Opportunity to add feature X, addresses user need Y, decision needed this quarter for roadmap"
  - "Insight: 3 facts - 60% of users request this feature, competitors have it, estimated 15% revenue lift → this means high user demand and competitive necessity"
  - "Recommendation: Build feature X in Q2, prioritize over feature Y → this works because user demand is clear, competitive pressure is high, and revenue upside is significant"
  - "Next Steps: This week (get alignment), Next month (start design), Q2 (build and launch) - monthly updates to leadership"
