# P10 - Executive Communication

**Formula:** `Context → Insight → Recommendation → Next Steps`

---

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
START: Executive needs to decide / align quickly
│
├─ 1) Context (WHY this matters)
│   │
│   ├─ One-sentence situation
│   │   ├─ What changed?
│   │   ├─ Why now?
│   │   └─ What's at stake?
│   │
│   └─ Set the frame
│       ├─ Business goal (revenue, growth, risk, efficiency)
│       └─ Decision owner / timeline
│
├─ 2) Insight (WHAT we learned)
│   │
│   ├─ 2–3 facts only (no analysis dump)
│   │   ├─ Data signal
│   │   ├─ User / market signal
│   │   └─ Constraint or risk
│   │
│   └─ Translate data → meaning
│       ├─ "This means…"
│       └─ "The implication is…"
│
├─ 3) Recommendation (WHAT to do)
│   │
│   ├─ Clear decision
│   │   ├─ Do X
│   │   ├─ Do X over Y (explicit tradeoff)
│   │   └─ Do X now, not later
│   │
│   └─ Why this is right
│       ├─ Upside
│       ├─ Risk (acknowledged, not hidden)
│       └─ Why alternatives are worse
│
└─ 4) Next Steps (HOW it happens)
    │
    ├─ Immediate actions (30–60–90 days)
    ├─ Owner(s)
    ├─ Success metric
    └─ Decision checkpoints / update cadence
```

## 🔑 Golden Rule

Executives don't want *analysis*.
They want **confidence + clarity + accountability**.

## 📌 Sample: Google Flights Ads Decision

**Question:**
"Present the recommendation on whether to add ads to Google Flights."

```
START: Should Google Flights add ads?
│
├─ 1) Context
│   ├─ Flights revenue growth has plateaued
│   ├─ Ads could unlock a new monetization stream
│   └─ Risk: user trust + search neutrality
│
├─ 2) Insight
│   ├─ Ads increase revenue 12–18% in similar products
│   ├─ Users are most sensitive during checkout
│   └─ Trust loss correlates with long-term churn
│
├─ 3) Recommendation
│   ├─ Introduce ads ONLY on search results
│   ├─ No ads on booking or price comparison pages
│   └─ Cap ad density with strict relevance rules
│
└─ 4) Next Steps
    ├─ 90-day pilot in 2 markets
    ├─ Metric: revenue lift vs repeat usage
    ├─ Weekly exec readout
    └─ Kill switch if trust metrics dip >2%
```

## 📄 1-Pager Template (Copy-Paste Ready)

```
TITLE: Decision on <X>

Context:
<Why this decision matters now>

Key Insights:
• Insight 1
• Insight 2
• Insight 3

Recommendation:
<Clear action + tradeoff>

Why This Works:
• Upside
• Risks (and mitigations)
• Why alternatives lose

Next Steps:
• Action – Owner – Metric – Date

## 🔑 5-Second Recall

```
Why now?
→ What matters?
→ What should we do?
→ What happens next?
```

If you want, next we can do **P11 – Stakeholder Alignment**, or I can compress **P1–P10 into a single executive interview cheat sheet** for fast drilling.
