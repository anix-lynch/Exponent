# Executive Study Plan: P15C - Decision-Making & Tradeoffs
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, not per-question  
**Time:** 2-3 hours total across 3 passes  
**Source:** ~15 questions → 1 concept bucket → 1 high-impact bucket

**❤️ = "Hedgehog Answer"** - Your fallback narrative if you know nothing. Master these first!

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15C (DECISION-MAKING & TRADEOFFS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "decision" or "tradeoff" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Decision Keywords:
- "decision", "tradeoff", "prioritization", "say no", "choose between", "decide"
- "prioritize", "make a call", "judgment", "choose", "pick"

### Implicit P15C Indicators:
- **Decision questions:** "Tell me about a prioritization tradeoff", "Time you had to say no", "How do you make decisions?"
- **Tradeoff questions:** "Tell me about a tradeoff", "How do you handle tradeoffs?", "Choose between options"
- **Prioritization questions:** "Tell me about prioritizing", "How do you decide what not to build?", "Multiple projects"

### P15C vs P6 Distinction:
- **P15C (Decision-Making & Tradeoffs):** "Tell me about a time you made a prioritization tradeoff" → Focus: Past experience, STAR format
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "How do you prioritize?" → Focus: Framework, process

### P15C vs P7 Distinction:
- **P15C (Decision-Making & Tradeoffs):** "Tell me about a time you made a tradeoff" → Focus: Past experience, STAR
- **P7 (Tradeoff Framing):** "How do you frame tradeoffs?" → Focus: Framework, analysis

### Red Flags (NOT P15C):
- "How do you prioritize?" → P6 (Prioritization) - if framework-focused
- "How do you frame tradeoffs?" → P7 (Tradeoff Framing) - if framework-focused

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Decision-Making & Tradeoffs Framework
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Tell me about a prioritization tradeoff" or "Time you had to say no" - decision-making questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action (Decision-Making Focus) → Result (STAR)
- **Situation:** Context (What was the decision? When? Where?), Challenge (What was the tradeoff between options? What was the prioritization challenge? What made it difficult?)
- **Task:** Your responsibility (What was my responsibility?), Decision needed (What decision needed to be made?), Goal (What was the goal?)
- **Action:** Framework used (RICE, Cost/benefit, Impact/effort, etc.), Factors considered (User impact, Business impact, Technical feasibility, Risk, Timeline, Resources), Stakeholders consulted (Who I talked to, What input I gathered), Decision made (What I decided, Why this option), Why I chose this (My reasoning, Tradeoffs evaluated, Alternatives considered, Judgment)
- **Result:** Outcome (What happened? What was the result? Did the decision work?), Impact (What was the impact?), Learning (What did I learn? Focus on showing good judgment, not just process)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Prioritization tradeoff: Situation (Decision needed, tradeoffs, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I approached - framework, factors, stakeholders, decision, reasoning), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"
- "Say no: Situation (Request, context, constraints), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I handled - reasoning, communication, alternatives), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1965: Tell me about a time when you made a prioritization tradeoff. (prioritization tradeoff angle)
- Q1948: Tell me about a time when you had to say no to someone. (saying no angle)
- Q1939: Tell me about a time when you had to make a decision quickly. (quick decision angle)
- Q1967: Tell me about a time when you made an important decision without your boss's approval. (independent decision angle)
- Q2007: Tell me about a time when you were forced to prioritize multiple projects. (multi-project prioritization angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Situation → Task → Action (Decision-Making Focus) → Result (STAR)`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When answering decision-making questions, I use Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR), but emphasize decision-making structure and judgment.

**1️⃣ Situation** → What was the decision? When? Where?
  - **Challenge:** What was the tradeoff between options? What was the prioritization challenge? What made it difficult?

**2️⃣ Task** → What was my responsibility? What decision needed to be made? What was the goal?

**3️⃣ Action** → I use 'I' statements, show structure:
  - **Framework used:** RICE, Cost/benefit, Impact/effort, etc.
  - **Factors considered:** User impact, Business impact, Technical feasibility, Risk, Timeline, Resources
  - **Stakeholders consulted:** Who I talked to, What input I gathered
  - **Decision made:** What I decided, Why this option
  - **Why I chose this:** My reasoning, Tradeoffs evaluated, Alternatives considered, Judgment

**4️⃣ Result** → What happened? What was the result? Did the decision work? What was the impact? What did I learn? (Focus on showing good judgment, not just process).

**Key Principle:** Show structured thinking, good judgment, and stakeholder consideration.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1965 (Prioritization tradeoff):** Focus on prioritization
  - "Situation: Decision [choose between options X and Y], Context [when/where], Challenge [both important, limited resources, time pressure]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [prioritize effectively, maximize impact], Constraints [resources, time, stakeholders]"
  - "Action: How I approached [Framework: Used RICE (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) or similar, Factors: User impact, business impact, technical feasibility, risk, timeline, resources, Stakeholders: Consulted [who], gathered input, Decision: Chose [option X] over [option Y], Why: Reasoning - higher impact, lower risk, better ROI, Tradeoffs: [what I gave up, why it was worth it], Alternatives: [what I considered, why I didn't choose them]"
  - "Result: Outcome [what happened - did it work?], Impact [quantify - user impact, business impact, metrics], Learning [what I learned, how I refined my approach]"
  - "Focus on showing structured thinking and good judgment"

- **Q1948 (Say no):** Focus on saying no
  - "Situation: Request [specific request], Context [when/where], Challenge [request was important but conflicted with priorities, needed to say no diplomatically]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [say no while maintaining relationship, explain reasoning], Constraints [stakeholder relationship, priorities, resources]"
  - "Action: How I handled it [Reasoning: Explained why - priorities, resources, impact, Communication: Clear, respectful, offered alternatives, Alternatives: Suggested other options, compromises, future consideration, Framing: Framed as prioritization, not rejection], Why [reasoning, stakeholder considerations]"
  - "Result: Outcome [what happened - relationship maintained? Request handled?], Impact [quantify - stakeholder satisfaction, team impact, priority impact], Learning [what I learned, how I refined my approach]"
  - "Focus on showing judgment and relationship management"
