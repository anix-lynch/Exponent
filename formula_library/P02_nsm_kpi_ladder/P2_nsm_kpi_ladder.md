# P2 - NSM + KPI Ladder

**Formula:** `Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails → Dashboard`

Think of this as: *one outcome → drivers → early signals → safety rails → how you watch it.*

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
GOAL: What success actually means
│
├─ NSM (North Star Metric)
│   └─ Single metric that best represents user + business value
│
├─ INPUT KPIs (What drives the NSM)
│   ├─ User behavior drivers
│   ├─ Supply / quality drivers
│   └─ Monetization drivers
│
├─ LEADING INDICATORS (Early signals)
│   ├─ Short-term behaviors
│   ├─ Funnel entry / activation signals
│   └─ Quality proxies
│
├─ GUARDRAILS (What must NOT break)
│   ├─ User trust
│   ├─ Long-term health
│   ├─ Cost / abuse / compliance
│
└─ DASHBOARD (How you monitor)
    ├─ NSM (top, always visible)
    ├─ Input KPIs (weekly)
    ├─ Leading indicators (daily)
    └─ Guardrails (alerts)
```

## 📌 Sample 1: Design Instagram Explore

```
NSM:
└─ Weekly Engaged Explore Users

INPUT KPIs:
├─ Content relevance score
├─ % sessions with Explore click
└─ Avg posts viewed per Explore session

LEADING INDICATORS:
├─ First-session Explore click rate
├─ Time-to-first-like
└─ Saves per session

GUARDRAILS:
├─ Content diversity
├─ Report / block rate
└─ Creator exposure fairness

DASHBOARD:
├─ NSM trend (WoW)
├─ Funnel: Feed → Explore → Engage
├─ Relevance vs complaints
└─ Alert if reports spike
```

## 📌 Sample 2: Design YouTube Advertising

```
NSM:
└─ Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer

INPUT KPIs:
├─ Ad impressions per session
├─ Ad CTR
└─ Conversion rate

LEADING INDICATORS:
├─ View-through rate
├─ Skip rate
└─ Ad load per minute

GUARDRAILS:
├─ User watch time
├─ Creator revenue share
└─ Ad fatigue complaints

DASHBOARD:
├─ Revenue NSM
├─ Ad load vs watch time
├─ CTR by format
└─ Alert on watch-time drop
```

---

## 📌 Sample 3: Design an Investment App (Robinhood-style)

```
NSM:
└─ Monthly Active Funded Users

INPUT KPIs:
├─ Funded account rate
├─ Trades per active user
└─ Feature adoption (alerts, watchlists)

LEADING INDICATORS:
├─ Time to first trade
├─ Portfolio views / day
└─ Notification open rate

GUARDRAILS:
├─ User losses concentration

## 🔑 Interview Heuristics (Say This Out Loud)

* "I'll start by defining **one North Star**, not 10 metrics."
* "Then I break it into **controllable input KPIs**."
* "I add **leading indicators** so we don't wait weeks to learn."
* "I always include **guardrails** to avoid gaming the system."
* "Finally, I'd put this into a **simple exec dashboard**."

If you want, next we can:

* Do **P3 Funnel Analysis** in the same ASCII style
* Or compress **P2 into a 30-second spoken answer script**
* Or map **which P2 questions are redundant so you only practice 3–5**
