## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13B_SOCIAL (DESIGN SOCIAL/COMMUNITY PLATFORMS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "social" or "community" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Social Keywords:
- "social media", "social platform", "community", "social network"
- "Facebook", "Instagram", "LinkedIn", "TikTok", "social features"
- "connect", "share", "follow", "feed", "profile", "network effects"

### Implicit P13B_SOCIAL Indicators:
- **Social focus:** "Design a social media app", "Design for Facebook", "Design social features"
- **Community focus:** "Design a community platform", "Design for connecting users"
- **Network effects:** "Design to increase connections", "Design to build network"
- **Engagement focus:** "Design to increase engagement", "Design feed", "Design discovery"

### P13B_SOCIAL vs P13B_CONTENT Distinction:
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Connection, network effects, community
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption, discovery, watch time

### P13B_SOCIAL vs P13B_MESSAGING Distinction:
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Public sharing, feed, network
- **P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication):** "Design a messaging app" → Focus: Private communication, real-time, reliability

### Red Flags (NOT P13B_SOCIAL):
- "Design a video streaming app" → P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media)
- "Design a messaging app" → P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication)
- "Design an e-commerce app" → P13B_ECOMMERCE (E-commerce/Shopping)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Social Platform Design
**Questions:** ~30 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a social media app" or "Design social features" - core social platform framework
- **Framework:** Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics
- **Users:** Who are the users? (Content creators, Content consumers, Community members), What are their needs? (Connection, Expression, Discovery)
- **Jobs:** What jobs do users need done? (Share content, Discover content, Connect with others, Build reputation), Job priority (Frequency, Importance)
- **Core Loop:** What is the engagement loop? (Create/consume content → Engage (like, comment, share) → Get feedback → Return to create more), How does it drive retention? (Daily usage, Network effects)
- **Key Features:** Core features (Feed/stream, Profile, Content creation, Engagement tools), Supporting features (Search, Discovery, Notifications, Groups)
- **Tradeoffs:** Engagement vs privacy, Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs consumer experience
- **Success Metrics:** Engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, Time spent, Sessions per user), Retention metrics (Day 1/7/30 retention, Network growth)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design social media app: Users (Content creators, consumers, community members), Jobs (Share, discover, connect, build reputation), Core Loop (Create → Engage → Get feedback → Return), Key Features (Feed, profile, creation tools, engagement), Tradeoffs (Engagement vs privacy, Quality vs quantity), Success Metrics (DAU, time spent, retention)"
- "Design LinkedIn for students: Users (Students, recruiters, alumni), Jobs (Network, find jobs, learn, build profile), Core Loop (Connect → Share → Engage → Return), Key Features (Profile, feed, job search, networking), Tradeoffs (Professional vs social, Quality vs quantity), Success Metrics (Connections, job applications, retention)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q31: As a Facebook PM, what would you do to design a product for hobbies? (social product design angle)
- Q352: Design a LinkedIn for blue collar workers. (professional network design angle)
- Q265: Design a birthday app for Facebook. (social feature design angle)
- Q666: Design the 'For You' page on TikTok. (feed design angle)
- Q649: Design Instagram's Explore page. (discovery design angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing a social platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics.

**1️⃣ Users** → Who are the users? (Content creators, Content consumers, Community members), What are their needs? (Connection, Expression, Discovery).

**2️⃣ Jobs** → What jobs do users need done? (Share content, Discover content, Connect with others, Build reputation), Prioritize by Frequency and Importance.

**3️⃣ Core Loop** → What is the engagement loop? (Create/consume content → Engage (like, comment, share) → Get feedback → Return to create more), How does it drive retention? (Daily usage, Network effects).

**4️⃣ Key Features** → Core features (Feed/stream, Profile, Content creation, Engagement tools), Supporting features (Search, Discovery, Notifications, Groups).

**5️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Engagement vs privacy, Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs consumer experience.

**6️⃣ Success Metrics** → Engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, Time spent, Sessions per user), Retention metrics (Day 1/7/30 retention, Network growth).

**Key Principle:** Design a core loop that drives daily engagement and network effects.

### BUCKET 2: Engagement & Core Loop
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design to increase engagement" or "Design feed" - same framework, with focus on engagement
- **Approach:** Same social platform framework, with focus on engagement loop and retention
- **Engagement Loop:** Entry point (How users enter), Core action (What they do), Reward/feedback (What they get), Return trigger (What brings them back)
- **Retention Drivers:** Daily usage (Habit formation, Notifications, Feed updates), Network effects (More users = more value, Connections, Content)
- **Success Metrics:** Engagement (DAU, time spent, sessions), Retention (Day 1/7/30, Cohort retention)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design feed: Entry point (App open, notification), Core action (Scroll, like, comment, share), Reward (New content, engagement, feedback), Return trigger (Notifications, new content, social pressure)"
- "Increase engagement: Optimize core loop, Add engagement features, Leverage network effects, Measure engagement metrics"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**

- Q2740: You're a PM at Instagram responsible for building the Reels feature. How would you define and measure its success? (feature success angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Users → Jobs → Core Loop (Engagement Focus) → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When focusing on engagement and core loop, I use the same social platform framework but emphasize the engagement loop and retention.

**1️⃣ Users & Jobs** → Identify users and their jobs to understand what drives engagement.

**2️⃣ Core Loop (Engagement Focus)** → Entry point (How users enter - app open, notification, share), Core action (What they do - create, consume, engage), Reward/feedback (What they get - likes, comments, new content, social validation), Return trigger (What brings them back - notifications, new content, social pressure, habit).

**3️⃣ Key Features (Engagement)** → Feed (personalized, engaging), Engagement tools (like, comment, share), Notifications (bring users back), Discovery (new content, connections).

**4️⃣ Tradeoffs** → Engagement vs privacy (balance), Quality vs quantity (prioritize quality), Creator vs consumer (support both).

**5️⃣ Success Metrics** → Engagement (DAU, time spent, sessions per user), Retention (Day 1/7/30 retention, Cohort retention, Network growth).

**Key Principle:** Design a core loop that creates daily habits and leverages network effects.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q666 (Design TikTok 'For You' page):** Focus on feed design
  - "Users: Content creators, Viewers"
