## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13B_SOCIAL (DESIGN SOCIAL/COMMUNITY PLATFORMS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "social" or "community" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Social Keywords:
- "social media", "social platform", "community", "social network"
- "Facebook", "Instagram", "LinkedIn", "TikTok", "social features"
- "connect", "share", "follow", "feed", "profile", "network effects"

### Implicit P13B_SOCIAL Indicators:
- **Social focus:** "Design a social media app", "Design for Facebook", "Design social features"
- **Community focus:** "Design a community platform", "Design for connecting users"
- **Network effects:** "Design to increase connections", "Design to build network"
- **Engagement focus:** "Design to increase engagement", "Design feed", "Design discovery"

### P13B_SOCIAL vs P13B_CONTENT Distinction:
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Connection, network effects, community
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption, discovery, watch time

### P13B_SOCIAL vs P13B_MESSAGING Distinction:
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Public sharing, feed, network
- **P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication):** "Design a messaging app" → Focus: Private communication, real-time, reliability

### Red Flags (NOT P13B_SOCIAL):
- "Design a video streaming app" → P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media)
- "Design a messaging app" → P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication)
- "Design an e-commerce app" → P13B_ECOMMERCE (E-commerce/Shopping)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Social Platform Design
**Questions:** ~30 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a social media app" or "Design social features" - core social platform framework
- **Framework:** Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics
- **Users:** Who are the users? (Content creators, Content consumers, Community members), What are their needs? (Connection, Expression, Discovery)
- **Jobs:** What jobs do users need done? (Share content, Discover content, Connect with others, Build reputation), Job priority (Frequency, Importance)
- **Core Loop:** What is the engagement loop? (Create/consume content → Engage (like, comment, share) → Get feedback → Return to create more), How does it drive retention? (Daily usage, Network effects)
- **Key Features:** Core features (Feed/stream, Profile, Content creation, Engagement tools), Supporting features (Search, Discovery, Notifications, Groups)
- **Tradeoffs:** Engagement vs privacy, Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs consumer experience
- **Success Metrics:** Engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, Time spent, Sessions per user), Retention metrics (Day 1/7/30 retention, Network growth)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design social media app: Users (Content creators, consumers, community members), Jobs (Share, discover, connect, build reputation), Core Loop (Create → Engage → Get feedback → Return), Key Features (Feed, profile, creation tools, engagement), Tradeoffs (Engagement vs privacy, Quality vs quantity), Success Metrics (DAU, time spent, retention)"
- "Design LinkedIn for students: Users (Students, recruiters, alumni), Jobs (Network, find jobs, learn, build profile), Core Loop (Connect → Share → Engage → Return), Key Features (Profile, feed, job search, networking), Tradeoffs (Professional vs social, Quality vs quantity), Success Metrics (Connections, job applications, retention)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q31: As a Facebook PM, what would you do to design a product for hobbies? (social product design angle)
- Q352: Design a LinkedIn for blue collar workers. (professional network design angle)
- Q265: Design a birthday app for Facebook. (social feature design angle)
- Q666: Design the 'For You' page on TikTok. (feed design angle)
- Q649: Design Instagram's Explore page. (discovery design angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When designing a social platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics. First, I identify Users: Who are the users? (Content creators, Content consumers, Community members), What are their needs? (Connection, Expression, Discovery). Then I define Jobs: What jobs do users need done? (Share content, Discover content, Connect with others, Build reputation), Prioritize by Frequency and Importance. Next, I design Core Loop: What is the engagement loop? (Create/consume content → Engage (like, comment, share) → Get feedback → Return to create more), How does it drive retention? (Daily usage, Network effects). I design Key Features: Core features (Feed/stream, Profile, Content creation, Engagement tools), Supporting features (Search, Discovery, Notifications, Groups). I consider Tradeoffs: Engagement vs privacy, Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs consumer experience. Finally, I define Success Metrics: Engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, Time spent, Sessions per user), Retention metrics (Day 1/7/30 retention, Network growth). The key is designing a core loop that drives daily engagement and network effects."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q31 (Design product for hobbies):** Focus on hobby social platform → "To design a product for hobbies, I'd: Users (Hobby enthusiasts (creators), Hobby learners (consumers), Community members), Needs (Connection with like-minded people, Expression of passion, Discovery of new hobbies), Jobs (Share hobby content, Discover new hobbies, Connect with hobbyists, Learn from experts), Core Loop (Create hobby content → Share → Get feedback → Discover new content → Return to create more), Key Features (Feed (hobby content), Profile (hobby showcase), Creation tools (photos, videos, tutorials), Engagement (like, comment, follow), Discovery (hobby recommendations, trending), Groups (hobby communities)), Tradeoffs (Engagement vs privacy - balance sharing with privacy, Quality vs quantity - focus on quality content, Creator vs consumer - support both), Success Metrics (Engagement: DAU, time spent, sessions | Retention: Day 1/7/30 retention, Network growth). I'd prioritize the core loop of creating and discovering hobby content."

- **Q352 (Design LinkedIn for blue collar workers):** Emphasize professional network → "To design LinkedIn for blue collar workers, I'd: Users (Blue collar workers (job seekers), Employers (hiring), Community (peers, mentors)), Needs (Job opportunities, Skill development, Professional network, Recognition), Jobs (Find jobs, Showcase skills, Network, Learn, Build reputation), Core Loop (Create profile → Connect → Share work → Get opportunities → Return to engage), Key Features (Profile (skills, work history, certifications), Feed (job postings, industry news, peer updates), Job search (filtered for blue collar jobs), Networking (connect with peers, employers), Learning (skill courses, certifications), Recommendations (job matches, skill gaps)), Tradeoffs (Professional vs social - keep it professional, Quality vs quantity - focus on quality connections, Job seeker vs employer - balance both), Success Metrics (Engagement: Profile views, connections, job applications | Retention: Monthly active users, job placements, network growth). I'd focus on job opportunities and skill development as the core value."

### BUCKET 2: Engagement & Core Loop
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design to increase engagement" or "Design feed" - same framework, with focus on engagement
- **Approach:** Same social platform framework, with focus on engagement loop and retention
- **Engagement Loop:** Entry point (How users enter), Core action (What they do), Reward/feedback (What they get), Return trigger (What brings them back)
- **Retention Drivers:** Daily usage (Habit formation, Notifications, Feed updates), Network effects (More users = more value, Connections, Content)
- **Success Metrics:** Engagement (DAU, time spent, sessions), Retention (Day 1/7/30, Cohort retention)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design feed: Entry point (App open, notification), Core action (Scroll, like, comment, share), Reward (New content, engagement, feedback), Return trigger (Notifications, new content, social pressure)"
- "Increase engagement: Optimize core loop, Add engagement features, Leverage network effects, Measure engagement metrics"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q666: Design the 'For You' page on TikTok. (feed design angle)
- Q649: Design Instagram's Explore page. (discovery design angle)
- Q3.3: How would you improve the LinkedIn home page? (homepage improvement angle)
- Q1545: How would you redesign Instagram's DM feature? (feature redesign angle)
- Q2740: You're a PM at Instagram responsible for building the Reels feature. How would you define and measure its success? (feature success angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When focusing on engagement and core loop, I use the same social platform framework but emphasize the engagement loop and retention. I identify Users and their Jobs to understand what drives engagement. I design Core Loop with engagement in mind: Entry point (How users enter - app open, notification, share), Core action (What they do - create, consume, engage), Reward/feedback (What they get - likes, comments, new content, social validation), Return trigger (What brings them back - notifications, new content, social pressure, habit). I design Key Features that support the core loop: Feed (personalized, engaging), Engagement tools (like, comment, share), Notifications (bring users back), Discovery (new content, connections). I consider Tradeoffs: Engagement vs privacy (balance), Quality vs quantity (prioritize quality), Creator vs consumer (support both). I define Success Metrics: Engagement (DAU, time spent, sessions per user), Retention (Day 1/7/30 retention, Cohort retention, Network growth). The key is designing a core loop that creates daily habits and leverages network effects."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q666 (Design TikTok 'For You' page):** Focus on feed design → "To design TikTok's 'For You' page, I'd: Users (Content creators, Viewers), Jobs (Discover content, Watch videos, Engage, Create), Core Loop (Open app → Scroll 'For You' → Watch video → Engage (like, comment, share) → Discover more → Return), Key Features (Personalized feed (algorithm-based), Video player (autoplay, sound), Engagement tools (like, comment, share, follow), Discovery (trending, recommendations), Creation (easy video creation)), Tradeoffs (Engagement vs privacy - balance personalization with privacy, Quality vs quantity - prioritize quality content, Creator vs consumer - support both), Success Metrics (Engagement: Watch time, sessions, DAU | Retention: Day 1/7/30 retention, Video completion rate, Network growth). I'd prioritize the algorithm that personalizes content and drives watch time."
