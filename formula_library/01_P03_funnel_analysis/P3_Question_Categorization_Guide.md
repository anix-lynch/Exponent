# P3 Questions — How to Categorize (USE THIS)

Every P3 question fits into **ONE** of these buckets.
Identify the bucket first → answer becomes obvious.

---

## 🟦 1) FUNNEL DROP-OFF

**Signal words**

* "drop-off"
* "conversion"
* "not completing"
* "from X to Y"
* "why users don't finish…"

**Examples**

* 55% don't complete application
* 25% drop during signup
* Checkout abandonment

**Approach**
→ Define steps → measure conversion → find biggest drop → fix friction

---

## 🟩 2) METRIC DECLINE / DIAGNOSIS

**Signal words**

* "metric is down"
* "engagement dropped"
* "NRR decreasing"
* "watch time fell"

**Examples**

* Engagement ↓
* ROAS ↓
* Retention ↓

**Approach**
→ Validate data → segment → find driver → explain why

---

## 🟨 3) GROWTH / INCREASE X

**Signal words**

* "increase"
* "grow"
* "improve"
* "drive more"

**Examples**

* Increase bookings
* Increase transactions
* Increase watch time

**Approach**
→ Decompose metric → identify lever → prioritize → test

---

## 🟧 4) PRIORITIZATION / WHAT TO FIX FIRST

**Signal words**

* "prioritize"
* "which would you focus on"
* "what would you do first"

**Examples**

* Multiple drop-offs shown
* Many problems listed

**Approach**
→ Impact × effort × confidence → pick 1 → justify

---

## 🟥 5) STRATEGY DISGUISED AS METRICS

These are the ones that feel "not funnel" — because they aren't.

**Signal words**

* "What should we do?"
* "How would you approach…"
* "What goals would you set?"
* "Design a strategy…"

**Examples**

* "As a PM, how would you increase bookings?"
* "What goals do you set for Uber Eats?"
* "How would you expand X into Y market?"

**Approach**
→ Define NSM → identify drivers → pick focus area → guardrails

---

## 🟪 6) DESIGN + METRICS

These mix UX thinking with metrics.

**Signal words**

* "design"
* "user journey"
* "come up with solutions"
* "interface"

**Examples**

* "Design solutions to increase conversion"
* "Walk me through the user journey"

**Approach**
→ Map journey → identify friction → propose fixes → metric impact

---

## 🟫 7) ESTIMATION / QUANT

Sometimes sneaks into P3.

**Signal words**

* "estimate"
* "how many"
* "size the market"

**Examples**

* "Estimate units sold"
* "TAM estimation"

**Approach**
→ Assumptions → math → sanity check

---

## ONE-LINE CHEAT (USE IN REAL TIME)

When you see a P3 question, ask yourself:

> "Am I explaining a **drop**, **growth**, **priority**, or **strategy**?"

Then apply the matching playbook above.

## Ultra-short mapping (memorize)

| Question sounds like… | It is actually…    |
| --------------------- | ------------------ |
| "Why drop?"           | Funnel / Diagnosis |
| "How increase?"       | Growth             |
| "What first?"         | Prioritization     |
| "What should we do?"  | Strategy           |
| "Design X"            | UX + Metrics       |
| "How many?"           | Estimation         |

## Quick Decision Tree

```
P3 Question
│
├─ Has "drop-off" / "conversion" / "not completing"?
│   └─ → FUNNEL DROP-OFF
│
├─ Has "down" / "decline" / "decreasing"?
│   └─ → METRIC DECLINE / DIAGNOSIS
│
├─ Has "increase" / "grow" / "improve"?
│   └─ → GROWTH / INCREASE X
│
├─ Has "prioritize" / "which first" / "what to focus"?
│   └─ → PRIORITIZATION
│
├─ Has "what should we do" / "how approach" / "goals"?
│   └─ → STRATEGY DISGUISED AS METRICS
│
├─ Has "design" / "user journey" / "interface"?
│   └─ → DESIGN + METRICS
│
└─ Has "estimate" / "how many" / "size"?
    └─ → ESTIMATION / QUANT
```

## Interview Application

**Step 1: Identify the bucket** (5 seconds)
- Scan for signal words
- Match to one of 7 categories

**Step 2: Apply the matching approach**
- Use the approach listed for that category
- Don't mix approaches (stay in one bucket)

**Step 3: Structure your answer**
- Follow the approach pattern
- Be explicit about which category you're addressing

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Every P3 question fits ONE bucket** - identify it first
2. **Signal words are your friend** - they tell you which bucket
3. **Don't mix approaches** - pick one and stick with it
4. **Funnel drop-off is the classic P3** - but not all P3 questions are funnels
5. **Strategy questions often masquerade as metrics** - recognize them

## Common Mistakes

❌ **Mistake**: Treating all P3 questions as funnel drop-off
✅ **Fix**: Identify the actual bucket first

❌ **Mistake**: Mixing multiple approaches in one answer
✅ **Fix**: Pick one bucket and apply its approach consistently

❌ **Mistake**: Not recognizing strategy questions
✅ **Fix**: Look for "what should we do" / "how approach" signals
