## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13B_CONTENT (DESIGN CONTENT/MEDIA PLATFORMS) QUESTIONS

**Even when "content" or "media" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Content Keywords:
- "content", "media", "streaming", "video", "audio", "podcast"
- "Netflix", "YouTube", "Spotify", "streaming service", "video platform"
- "watch", "listen", "consume", "discover content", "recommendation"

### Implicit P13B_CONTENT Indicators:
- **Content focus:** "Design a video streaming app", "Design a podcast platform", "Design for Netflix"
- **Consumption focus:** "Design for watching", "Design for listening", "Design content discovery"
- **Creator focus:** "Design for creators", "Design creator tools", "Design monetization"
- **Recommendation focus:** "Design recommendation engine", "Design discovery", "Design personalization"

### P13B_CONTENT vs P13B_SOCIAL Distinction:
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption, discovery, watch time
- **P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Connection, network effects, community

### P13B_CONTENT vs P13B_MESSAGING Distinction:
- **P13B_CONTENT (Content/Media):** "Design a video streaming app" → Focus: Content consumption, passive engagement
- **P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication):** "Design a messaging app" → Focus: Real-time communication, active engagement

### Red Flags (NOT P13B_CONTENT):
- "Design a social media app" → P13B_SOCIAL (Social/Community)
- "Design a messaging app" → P13B_MESSAGING (Messaging/Communication)
- "Design an e-commerce app" → P13B_ECOMMERCE (E-commerce/Shopping)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Content Platform Design
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a video streaming app" or "Design a content platform" - core content platform framework
- **Framework:** Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics
- **Users:** Who are the users? (Content creators, Viewers/consumers, Advertisers if applicable), What are their needs? (Content discovery, Quality content, Monetization for creators)
- **Jobs:** What jobs do users need done? (Discover content, Consume content, Create content, Monetize content), Job priority (Frequency, Importance)
- **Core Loop:** What is the engagement loop? (Discover content → Watch/consume → Engage (like, comment) → Return for more), How does it drive retention? (Content library, Personalized recommendations)
- **Key Features:** Core features (Content library, Recommendation engine, Player/viewer, Creator tools), Supporting features (Search, Playlists, Social features)
- **Tradeoffs:** Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs viewer experience, Free vs paid content
- **Success Metrics:** Consumption metrics (Watch time, Completion rate, Sessions per user), Creator metrics (Creator satisfaction, Content upload rate)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design video streaming: Users (Content creators, Viewers, Advertisers), Jobs (Discover, watch, create, monetize), Core Loop (Discover → Watch → Engage → Return), Key Features (Library, recommendations, player, creator tools), Tradeoffs (Quality vs quantity, Creator vs viewer), Success Metrics (Watch time, completion rate, creator satisfaction)"
- "Design podcast platform: Users (Podcast creators, Listeners), Jobs (Discover podcasts, Listen, Create, Monetize), Core Loop (Discover → Listen → Subscribe → Return), Key Features (Library, recommendations, player, creator tools), Tradeoffs (Quality vs quantity, Creator vs listener), Success Metrics (Listen time, subscriptions, creator satisfaction)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q50: As a PM at Netflix, design something for kids. (content platform design angle)
- Q494: Design a streaming service like Netflix. (streaming service design angle)
- Q397: Design a podcast platform. (podcast platform design angle)
- Q375: Design a new feature for YouTube. (feature design angle)
- Q667: Design the 'Top Picks' feature for Netflix. (recommendation feature angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When designing a content platform, I use Users → Jobs → Core Loop → Key Features → Tradeoffs → Success Metrics. First, I identify Users: Who are the users? (Content creators, Viewers/consumers, Advertisers if applicable), What are their needs? (Content discovery, Quality content, Monetization for creators). Then I define Jobs: What jobs do users need done? (Discover content, Consume content, Create content, Monetize content), Prioritize by Frequency and Importance. Next, I design Core Loop: What is the engagement loop? (Discover content → Watch/consume → Engage (like, comment) → Return for more), How does it drive retention? (Content library, Personalized recommendations). I design Key Features: Core features (Content library, Recommendation engine, Player/viewer, Creator tools), Supporting features (Search, Playlists, Social features). I consider Tradeoffs: Content quality vs quantity, Creator vs viewer experience, Free vs paid content. Finally, I define Success Metrics: Consumption metrics (Watch time, Completion rate, Sessions per user), Creator metrics (Creator satisfaction, Content upload rate). The key is designing a core loop that drives content consumption and creator satisfaction."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q50 (Design Netflix for kids):** Focus on kids content platform → "To design Netflix for kids, I'd: Users (Kids (viewers), Parents (gatekeepers), Content creators), Needs (Age-appropriate content, Safe viewing, Educational value, Entertainment), Jobs (Discover kid-friendly content, Watch shows/movies, Learn, Have fun), Core Loop (Open app → Browse kid content → Watch → Complete → Return for more), Key Features (Kid-friendly library (curated, age-appropriate), Recommendation engine (personalized for kids), Player (simple controls, parental controls), Parental controls (time limits, content filters, viewing history), Profiles (kid profiles, parent profiles), Search (kid-safe search)), Tradeoffs (Quality vs quantity - prioritize quality, Educational vs entertainment - balance both, Parent control vs kid freedom - balance), Success Metrics (Consumption: Watch time, completion rate, sessions | Retention: Day 1/7/30 retention, Parent satisfaction, Content library size). I'd prioritize safety, age-appropriateness, and parental controls."

- **Q494 (Design streaming service like Netflix):** Emphasize streaming platform → "To design a streaming service like Netflix, I'd: Users (Content creators, Viewers, Advertisers if applicable), Needs (Content discovery, Quality content, Variety, Convenience), Jobs (Discover content, Watch shows/movies, Create content, Monetize), Core Loop (Open app → Browse/Discover → Watch → Complete → Return for more), Key Features (Content library (large, diverse), Recommendation engine (personalized, ML-based), Player (high quality, offline viewing), Profiles (multiple users), Search (powerful, filters), Playlists (watchlists, continue watching)), Tradeoffs (Quality vs quantity - balance, Original vs licensed - mix, Creator vs viewer - support both), Success Metrics (Consumption: Watch time, completion rate, sessions | Retention: Day 1/7/30 retention, Churn rate, Content library growth). I'd prioritize content discovery and watch time."

- Q50: As a PM at Netflix, design something for kids. (personalized content angle)
- Q375: Design a new feature for YouTube. (discovery feature angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When focusing on content discovery and recommendation, I use the same content platform framework but emphasize discovery and personalization. I identify Users and their Jobs to understand what content they want. I design Core Loop with discovery in mind: Entry point (How users discover - homepage, search, recommendations), Core action (Browse, search, watch), Reward (Find relevant content, personalized recommendations), Return trigger (New content, recommendations, trending). I design Key Features that support discovery: Recommendation engine (Personalized, ML-based, User preferences, Content similarity), Search (Powerful search, Filters, Categories), Trending (Popular content, New releases, Editor's picks), Homepage (Personalized rows, Recommendations, Continue watching). I consider Tradeoffs: Personalization vs diversity (balance), Quality vs quantity (prioritize quality), Creator vs viewer (support both). I define Success Metrics: Discovery metrics (Click-through rate, Watch time from recommendations, Completion rate), Engagement (Sessions, Time spent, Retention). The key is making it easy to discover relevant content through personalization and search."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q667 (Design 'Top Picks' for Netflix):** Focus on recommendation feature → "To design 'Top Picks' for Netflix, I'd: Users (Viewers looking for personalized recommendations), Jobs (Discover content they'll love, Save time browsing, Find new shows), Core Loop (Open app → See 'Top Picks' → Browse picks → Watch → Return), Key Features (Personalized picks (ML-based, user preferences, viewing history), Visual design (prominent, engaging), Content cards (preview, metadata, ratings), Easy access (top of homepage), Update frequency (daily, weekly)), Tradeoffs (Personalization vs diversity - balance, Quality vs quantity - prioritize quality, Popular vs niche - mix), Success Metrics (Discovery: CTR on picks, Watch time from picks, Completion rate | Engagement: Sessions, Time spent, Retention). I'd prioritize personalization and relevance to drive watch time."
