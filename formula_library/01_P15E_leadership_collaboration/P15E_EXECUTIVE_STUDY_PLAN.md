## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P15E (LEADERSHIP & COLLABORATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "leadership" or "collaboration" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Leadership Keywords:
- "leadership", "collaboration", "influence", "stakeholders", "cross-functional", "conflict"
- "work with execs", "influence roadmap", "disagreement", "communication style", "build trust"

### Implicit P15E Indicators:
- **Leadership questions:** "Tell me about influencing stakeholders", "How do you work with execs?", "Time you led a project"
- **Collaboration questions:** "Tell me about cross-functional work", "How do you handle disagreement?", "Time you worked with different teams"
- **Influence questions:** "How do you influence without authority?", "Tell me about influencing a roadmap", "How do you build trust?"

### P15E vs P11 Distinction:
- **P15E (Leadership & Collaboration):** "Tell me about a time you influenced stakeholders" → Focus: Past experience, STAR format
- **P11 (Stakeholder Alignment):** "How do you align stakeholders?" → Focus: Framework, process

### P15E vs P10 Distinction:
- **P15E (Leadership & Collaboration):** "Tell me about working with execs" → Focus: Past experience, STAR
- **P10 (Executive Communication):** "How would you explain X to executives?" → Focus: Communication framework

### Red Flags (NOT P15E):
- "How do you align stakeholders?" → P11 (Stakeholder Alignment) - if framework-focused
- "How would you explain X to executives?" → P10 (Executive Communication) - if framework-focused

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Leadership & Collaboration Framework
**Questions:** ~50 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Tell me about influencing stakeholders" or "Time you worked cross-functionally" - leadership and collaboration questions
- **Framework:** Situation → Task → Action (Leadership/Collaboration Focus) → Result (STAR)
- **Situation:** Context (What was the situation? When? Where?), Challenge (Cross-functional work, Conflict or disagreement, Influencing without authority, Communication challenge), What made it difficult?
- **Task:** Your responsibility (What was my responsibility?), Goal (What needed to be achieved? What was the goal?)
- **Action:** Communication approach (How I communicated - clear, transparent, tailored to audience), Building relationships (How I built trust - consistency, respect, value), Resolving conflict (How I resolved - understanding both sides, finding common ground, win-win solutions), Influencing stakeholders (How I influenced - data, relationships, alignment, framing), Why I did it this way (My reasoning, Stakeholder considerations)
- **Result:** Outcome (What happened? What was the result? Did I achieve the goal?), Impact (What was the impact?), Learning (What did I learn? Focus on relationship building and influence, not just outcome)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Influence stakeholders: Situation (Stakeholders, disagreement, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I influenced - communication, relationships, data, alignment), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"
- "Cross-functional work: Situation (Cross-functional team, challenge, context), Task (My role, goal), Action (How I collaborated - communication, alignment, influence), Result (Outcome, impact, learning)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1954: Tell me about a time when you influenced a product roadmap. (roadmap influence angle)
- Q1929: Tell me about a time when you had to break a complex problem down for different cross-functional teams. (cross-functional collaboration angle)
- Q243: Describe your communication style when working with C-suite executives. (executive communication angle)
- Q2073: Tell me about a time you managed a complex, cross-functional project. (cross-functional project angle)
- Q205: Describe a program you led from start to finish, including challenges, conflict resolution, and its overall impact. (program leadership angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Situation → Task → Action (Leadership/Collaboration Focus) → Result (STAR)`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When answering leadership and collaboration questions, I use Situation → Task → Action → Result (STAR), but emphasize leadership and collaboration skills.

**1️⃣ Situation** → What was the situation? When? Where?
  - **Challenge:** Cross-functional work, Conflict or disagreement, Influencing without authority, Communication challenge. What made it difficult?

**2️⃣ Task** → What was my responsibility? What needed to be achieved? What was the goal?

**3️⃣ Action** → I use 'I' statements, show leadership:
  - **Communication approach:** How I communicated - clear, transparent, tailored to audience
  - **Building relationships:** How I built trust - consistency, respect, value
  - **Resolving conflict:** How I resolved - understanding both sides, finding common ground, win-win solutions
  - **Influencing stakeholders:** How I influenced - data, relationships, alignment, framing
  - **Why I did it this way:** My reasoning, Stakeholder considerations

**4️⃣ Result** → What happened? What was the result? Did I achieve the goal? What was the impact? What did I learn? (Focus on relationship building and influence, not just outcome).

**Key Principle:** Show empathy, influence, communication, and relationship building.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1954 (Influenced product roadmap):** Focus on influence
  - "Situation: Roadmap [specific roadmap decision], Context [when/where], Challenge [stakeholders disagreed, needed alignment, constraints]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [influence roadmap, get alignment, make good decision], Constraints [stakeholders, resources, timeline]"
  - "Action: How I influenced [Communication: Clear communication, data-driven, tailored to each stakeholder, Relationships: Built trust, understood perspectives, found common ground, Data: Used data to support position, showed impact, addressed concerns, Alignment: 1:1s before group meetings, incorporated feedback, built coalition, Framing: Framed decision clearly, showed tradeoffs, made recommendation], Why [reasoning, stakeholder considerations]"
  - "Result: Outcome [roadmap influenced, decision made, alignment achieved], Impact [quantify - product impact, stakeholder satisfaction, team impact], Learning [what I learned, how I refined my approach]"
  - "Focus on showing influence without authority and stakeholder management"

- **Q243 (Communication style with execs):** Focus on executive communication
  - "Situation: Working with execs [specific context], Context [when/where], Challenge [execs have limited time, need clear communication, different communication style]"
  - "Task: My role [PM/Engineer/etc], Goal [communicate effectively, get decisions, build trust], Constraints [exec time, complexity, need clarity]"
  - "Action: How I communicated [Style: Clear, concise, data-driven, bottom-line up front, Tailored: Adapted to exec preferences, focused on business impact, Framing: Framed clearly, showed tradeoffs, made recommendations, Follow-up: Clear next steps, ownership, timeline], Why [reasoning, exec considerations]"
  - "Result: Outcome [effective communication, decisions made, trust built], Impact [quantify - decision speed, exec satisfaction, team impact], Learning [what I learned, how I refined my approach]"
  - "Focus on showing executive communication skills"
