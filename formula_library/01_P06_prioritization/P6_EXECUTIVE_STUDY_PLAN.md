## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P6 (PRIORITIZATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "prioritize" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Prioritization Keywords:
- "prioritize", "prioritization", "what to build first", "which comes first"
- "decide between", "choose between", "what should we do first"
- "roadmap", "what to focus on", "resource allocation"

### Implicit P6 Indicators:
- **Feature prioritization:** "which features to build?", "prioritize competing features", "MVP features"
- **Roadmap questions:** "how to structure roadmap?", "what to build next?", "create roadmap"
- **Resource constraints:** "limited resources", "conflicting priorities", "everything is urgent"
- **Tradeoff questions:** "bug vs feature", "foundational work vs features", "balance X and Y"
- **Decision questions:** "what would you build first?", "where to invest?", "which market?"

### P6 vs P5 Distinction:
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "Which features to build first?" → Focus: RANK options (Impact × Confidence × Ease)
- **P5 (Segmentation):** "Which users should we focus on?" → Focus: DEFINE segments (Persona × Behavior × Value)

### P6 vs P7 Distinction:
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "What to build first?" → Focus: RANK options using RICE
- **P6 (Tradeoff Framing):** "How to balance X and Y?" → Focus: FRAME tradeoffs (winners/losers/guardrails)

### P6 vs P1 Distinction:
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "Which features to prioritize?" → Focus: RANK what to build
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Orders down 25%" → Focus: DIAGNOSE why metric dropped

### Red Flags (NOT P6):
- "Orders down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)
- "Which users should we focus on?" → P5 (Segmentation)
- "How to balance X and Y?" → P7 (Tradeoff Framing)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Classic Feature Prioritization
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Which features to build first?" or "Prioritize competing features" - core RICE framework
- **Framework:** List Candidates → Score (Impact × Confidence × Ease) → Compute RICE → Rank → Decide + Communicate
- **Impact (1-3):** 3 = massive user/business impact, 2 = meaningful but local, 1 = minor improvement
- **Confidence (0.4-1.0):** 1.0 = strong data/past proof, 0.7 = some data/informed guess, 0.4 = mostly hypothesis
- **Ease (1-3):** 3 = very easy/quick win, 2 = medium effort, 1 = hard/long-term
- **RICE Score:** Impact × Confidence × Ease → Higher = higher priority
- **Decide + Communicate:** What we do first, what we delay, why (tradeoffs)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Feature A: Impact 3 × Confidence 0.9 × Ease 3 = RICE 8.1 → Build first"
- "Feature B: Impact 2 × Confidence 0.6 × Ease 1 = RICE 1.2 → Defer"
- "Feature C: Impact 2 × Confidence 0.7 × Ease 2 = RICE 2.8 → Schedule next"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q158: Choose a product and tell me how you would prioritize new features for it.
- Q1138: How do you prioritize competing features?
- Q1139: How do you prioritize features for a product launch?
- Q1323: How would you determine which features to include in a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
- Q92: As a YouTube PM, how would you evaluate the suggestion to develop a tool for content creators to generate ideas with scripts automatically?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `List Features → Score RICE (Impact × Confidence × Ease) → Rank → Decide → Communicate`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When prioritizing features, I use the RICE framework: Impact × Confidence × Ease.

**1️⃣ List All Features** → All candidate features.

**2️⃣ Score Impact** → 1-3: 3 = massive impact, 2 = meaningful but local, 1 = minor.

**3️⃣ Score Confidence** → 0.4-1.0: 1.0 = strong data, 0.7 = some data, 0.4 = hypothesis.

**4️⃣ Score Ease** → 1-3: 3 = easy/quick win, 2 = medium, 1 = hard.

**5️⃣ Compute RICE** → Impact × Confidence × Ease for each feature.

**6️⃣ Rank** → Highest RICE first.

**7️⃣ Decide & Communicate** → What to build first (highest RICE), what to delay, why (tradeoffs).

**Key Principle:** RICE = objective prioritization - Impact × Confidence × Ease.

### BUCKET 2: Roadmap Prioritization
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "How to structure roadmap?" or "Create roadmap" - same RICE framework, applied to roadmap planning
- **Approach:** List roadmap items → Score RICE → Rank → Structure roadmap (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- **Time Horizons:** Short-term (high RICE, quick wins), Medium-term (strategic, medium RICE), Long-term (vision, lower RICE but strategic)
- **Communication:** Clear roadmap structure, what's in each phase, why items are sequenced

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Short-term roadmap: High RICE items (quick wins, high impact) → Build first"
- "Medium-term roadmap: Strategic items (medium RICE, dependencies) → Plan next"
- "Long-term roadmap: Vision items (lower RICE but strategic) → Future planning"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1137: How do you prioritize and structure roadmaps, deciding what to build and when?
- Q1247: How would you approach creating a product roadmap without prior knowledge of the product?
- Q1285: How would you create a short-term roadmap when production issues, sales pressure, and customer demands conflict?
- Q1286: How would you create a three-year roadmap as head of product?
- Q1252: How would you approach product planning?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `List Items → Score RICE → Rank → Organize by Time Horizon → Communicate`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When structuring a roadmap, I use RICE to prioritize items, then organize them by time horizon.

**1️⃣ List All Items** → All roadmap items.

**2️⃣ Score RICE** → Impact × Confidence × Ease for each.

**3️⃣ Rank** → Highest RICE first.

**4️⃣ Organize by Time Horizon** → Short-term (high RICE quick wins), medium-term (strategic items with dependencies), long-term (vision items, lower RICE but strategic).

**5️⃣ Communicate** → Roadmap structure clearly, what's in each phase, why items are sequenced.

**Key Principle:** Roadmap = RICE prioritization organized by time horizon.

---

### BUCKET 3: Resource-Constrained Prioritization
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Limited resources" or "Conflicting priorities" - same RICE framework, with resource constraints
- **Approach:** List options → Score RICE → Rank → Apply resource constraints → Decide what fits
- **Constraints:** Time (timeline cut), Budget (limited budget), People (few engineers), Scope (must deliver X)
- **Decision:** Highest RICE items that fit within constraints, communicate what's cut and why

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Timeline cut in half: Score options using RICE → Prioritize highest RICE items that fit timeline → Cut scope ruthlessly"
- "Limited budget: Score options using RICE → Prioritize highest RICE items within budget → Communicate what's cut"
- "Few engineers: Score options using RICE → Prioritize highest RICE items that fit capacity → Defer others"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q90: As a TPM, how would you handle a project with unchanged deliverables but a cut in the time period by half?
- Q1140: How do you prioritize strategic initiatives when resources are limited?
- Q1143: How do you prioritize when everything is urgent?
- Q1148: How do you set priorities with limited resources?
- Q2472: What would you do if you had to deliver a product or feature in half of the initial timeline?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `List Options → Score RICE → Rank → Apply Constraints → Select → Communicate`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When resources are constrained, I use RICE to prioritize, then apply constraints.

**1️⃣ List All Options** → All candidate items.

**2️⃣ Score RICE** → Impact × Confidence × Ease for each.

**3️⃣ Rank** → Highest RICE first.

**4️⃣ Apply Constraints** → Time, budget, people, scope.

**5️⃣ Select** → Highest RICE items that fit within constraints.

**6️⃣ Communicate** → What's included, what's cut, and why.

**Key Principle:** Ruthless prioritization - cut scope, not quality.

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q90 (Timeline cut in half):** Focus on timeline constraint
  - "List all deliverables, score using RICE, rank them"
  - "Identify highest RICE items that fit compressed timeline"
  - "Ruthlessly cut scope: remove nice-to-haves, simplify features, defer non-critical items"
  - "Communicate what's in scope, what's cut, and why"
  - "Goal: preserve core value, not everything"

- **Q1140 (Strategic initiatives with limited resources):** Emphasize strategic focus
  - "List strategic initiatives, score using RICE (Impact = strategic value, Confidence = certainty, Ease = resource needs), rank them"
  - "Prioritize highest RICE initiatives that fit resource constraints"
  - "Communicate what's funded, what's deferred, and why"
  - "Strategic alignment matters, but RICE helps make tough calls"

- **Q1143 (Everything is urgent):** Focus on urgency management

### BUCKET 4: Bug vs Feature / Tradeoff Prioritization
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Bug vs feature" or "Balance foundational work vs features" - RICE framework for tradeoffs
- **Approach:** List options (bug fixes, features, foundational work) → Score RICE → Rank → Decide tradeoff
- **Bug Fixes:** Impact = user impact (blocking vs minor), Confidence = 1.0 (known issue), Ease = varies
- **Features:** Impact = user/business value, Confidence = varies, Ease = varies
- **Foundational Work:** Impact = future leverage (compound value), Confidence = varies, Ease = usually low
- **Decision:** Highest RICE wins, but consider strategic importance and dependencies

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Bug blocking users: Impact 3 × Confidence 1.0 × Ease 2 = RICE 6.0 → Fix first"
- "Feature requested: Impact 2 × Confidence 0.7 × Ease 2 = RICE 2.8 → Build next"
- "Foundational work: Impact 3 × Confidence 1.0 × Ease 1 = RICE 3.0 → If it unlocks future features"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1536: How would you prioritize between fixing a bug or shipping a new feature?
- Q1052: How do you balance engineering foundational work with building new features?
- Q1244: How would you approach a situation where your business users are pushing for a new business requirement and your engineering team has found 3 bugs, which are repetitive in nature?
- Q1144: How do you resolve conflicting product requirements, and who determines which requirement takes priority?
- Q1539: How would you prioritize multiple requests from different teams?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `List Options → Score RICE → Compare → Consider Strategic → Decide → Communicate`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When prioritizing bugs vs features or tradeoffs, I use RICE to objectively compare.

**1️⃣ List All Options** → Bug fixes, features, foundational work.

**2️⃣ Score RICE for Each** → 
  - **Bugs:** Impact = user impact (blocking = 3, minor = 1), Confidence = 1.0 (known issue), Ease = varies
  - **Features:** Impact = user/business value, Confidence = varies, Ease = varies
  - **Foundational Work:** Impact = future leverage (compound value), Confidence = varies, Ease = usually low

**3️⃣ Compute RICE & Rank** → Highest RICE first.

**4️⃣ Consider Strategic** → Strategic importance and dependencies.

**5️⃣ Decide** → Highest RICE wins, but consider strategic factors.

**6️⃣ Communicate** → Decision and tradeoffs.

**Key Principle:** RICE provides objective comparison, but strategic factors matter too.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1536 (Bug vs feature):** Focus on comparison
  - "Score each using RICE"
  - "Bug: Impact = user impact (blocking users = 3, minor = 1), Confidence = 1.0 (known issue), Ease = fix complexity"
  - "Feature: Impact = user/business value, Confidence = data certainty, Ease = build effort"
  - "Compute RICE for each and compare"
  - "Generally, blocking bugs (high Impact) win, but high-value features with high RICE can take priority"
  - "Communicate decision and why"

- **Q1052 (Foundational work vs features):** Emphasize balance
  - "Score each using RICE"
  - "Foundational work: Impact = future leverage (compound value), Confidence = technical certainty, Ease = usually low (hard)"
  - "Features: Impact = immediate user value, Confidence = varies, Ease = varies"
  - "Foundational work wins when Impact is high (unlocks multiple features) and Confidence is high"
  - "Prioritize highest RICE items, considering strategic importance"
  - "Communicate balance and why foundational work matters when it compounds"
