## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P6 (PRIORITIZATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "prioritize" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Prioritization Keywords:
- "prioritize", "prioritization", "what to build first", "which comes first"
- "decide between", "choose between", "what should we do first"
- "roadmap", "what to focus on", "resource allocation"

### Implicit P6 Indicators:
- **Feature prioritization:** "which features to build?", "prioritize competing features", "MVP features"
- **Roadmap questions:** "how to structure roadmap?", "what to build next?", "create roadmap"
- **Resource constraints:** "limited resources", "conflicting priorities", "everything is urgent"
- **Tradeoff questions:** "bug vs feature", "foundational work vs features", "balance X and Y"
- **Decision questions:** "what would you build first?", "where to invest?", "which market?"

### P6 vs P5 Distinction:
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "Which features to build first?" → Focus: RANK options (Impact × Confidence × Ease)
- **P5 (Segmentation):** "Which users should we focus on?" → Focus: DEFINE segments (Persona × Behavior × Value)

### P6 vs P7 Distinction:
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "What to build first?" → Focus: RANK options using RICE
- **P6 (Tradeoff Framing):** "How to balance X and Y?" → Focus: FRAME tradeoffs (winners/losers/guardrails)

### P6 vs P1 Distinction:
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "Which features to prioritize?" → Focus: RANK what to build
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Orders down 25%" → Focus: DIAGNOSE why metric dropped

### Red Flags (NOT P6):
- "Orders down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)
- "Which users should we focus on?" → P5 (Segmentation)
- "How to balance X and Y?" → P7 (Tradeoff Framing)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Classic Feature Prioritization
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Which features to build first?" or "Prioritize competing features" - core RICE framework
- **Framework:** List Candidates → Score (Impact × Confidence × Ease) → Compute RICE → Rank → Decide + Communicate
- **Impact (1-3):** 3 = massive user/business impact, 2 = meaningful but local, 1 = minor improvement
- **Confidence (0.4-1.0):** 1.0 = strong data/past proof, 0.7 = some data/informed guess, 0.4 = mostly hypothesis
- **Ease (1-3):** 3 = very easy/quick win, 2 = medium effort, 1 = hard/long-term
- **RICE Score:** Impact × Confidence × Ease → Higher = higher priority
- **Decide + Communicate:** What we do first, what we delay, why (tradeoffs)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Feature A: Impact 3 × Confidence 0.9 × Ease 3 = RICE 8.1 → Build first"
- "Feature B: Impact 2 × Confidence 0.6 × Ease 1 = RICE 1.2 → Defer"
- "Feature C: Impact 2 × Confidence 0.7 × Ease 2 = RICE 2.8 → Schedule next"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q158: Choose a product and tell me how you would prioritize new features for it.
- Q1138: How do you prioritize competing features?
- Q1139: How do you prioritize features for a product launch?
- Q1323: How would you determine which features to include in a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)?
- Q92: As a YouTube PM, how would you evaluate the suggestion to develop a tool for content creators to generate ideas with scripts automatically?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When prioritizing features, I use the RICE framework: Impact × Confidence × Ease. First, I list all candidate features. Then I score each: Impact (1-3: 3 = massive impact, 2 = meaningful but local, 1 = minor), Confidence (0.4-1.0: 1.0 = strong data, 0.7 = some data, 0.4 = hypothesis), and Ease (1-3: 3 = easy/quick win, 2 = medium, 1 = hard). I compute RICE = Impact × Confidence × Ease for each feature and rank them. Finally, I decide what to build first (highest RICE), what to delay, and communicate why (tradeoffs)."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q158 (Prioritize new features for a product):** Focus on general prioritization → "To prioritize new features, I'd list all candidate features, then score each using RICE. For Impact, I'd assess user/business value (3 = affects all users, 2 = meaningful but local, 1 = minor). For Confidence, I'd use data (1.0 = strong data, 0.7 = some data, 0.4 = hypothesis). For Ease, I'd estimate effort (3 = quick win, 2 = medium, 1 = hard). I'd compute RICE for each and rank them. I'd build the highest RICE features first and communicate why others are delayed."

- **Q1138 (Prioritize competing features):** Emphasize competition → "When features compete, I'd use RICE to objectively compare them. I'd list all competing features, score each on Impact (user/business value), Confidence (data certainty), and Ease (effort). I'd compute RICE and rank them. The highest RICE wins, but I'd also consider strategic alignment and dependencies. I'd communicate the decision clearly, explaining why some features wait."

- **Q1139 (Prioritize features for product launch):** Focus on launch context → "For launch prioritization, I'd use RICE but weight Impact heavily (launch needs high impact). I'd list candidate features, score Impact (3 = core value, 2 = nice-to-have, 1 = edge case), Confidence (1.0 = proven, 0.7 = likely, 0.4 = risky), and Ease (3 = quick, 2 = medium, 1 = complex). I'd prioritize high Impact + high Confidence features for launch, deferring lower RICE items. I'd communicate what's in launch vs post-launch."

- **Q1323 (Features for MVP):** Emphasize MVP focus → "For MVP, I'd use RICE but prioritize high Impact + high Confidence features that deliver core value. I'd list candidate features, score Impact (3 = core value, 2 = important, 1 = nice-to-have), Confidence (1.0 = proven need, 0.7 = likely, 0.4 = uncertain), and Ease (3 = quick, 2 = medium, 1 = complex). For MVP, I'd focus on features with Impact 3 and Confidence ≥0.7, even if Ease is lower. I'd communicate what's in MVP vs future versions."

- **Q92 (YouTube PM evaluate AI tool for creators):** Focus on evaluation → "To evaluate the AI tool suggestion, I'd break it into options (idea generator, full scripts, analytics-driven) and score each using RICE. Impact: how much value for creators? Confidence: do we have data on creator needs? Ease: how hard to build? I'd compute RICE for each option and rank them. I'd recommend starting with highest RICE option (likely idea generator) and deferring riskier options (full scripts)."

### BUCKET 2: Roadmap Prioritization
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "How to structure roadmap?" or "Create roadmap" - same RICE framework, applied to roadmap planning
- **Approach:** List roadmap items → Score RICE → Rank → Structure roadmap (short-term, medium-term, long-term)
- **Time Horizons:** Short-term (high RICE, quick wins), Medium-term (strategic, medium RICE), Long-term (vision, lower RICE but strategic)
- **Communication:** Clear roadmap structure, what's in each phase, why items are sequenced

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Short-term roadmap: High RICE items (quick wins, high impact) → Build first"
- "Medium-term roadmap: Strategic items (medium RICE, dependencies) → Plan next"
- "Long-term roadmap: Vision items (lower RICE but strategic) → Future planning"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1137: How do you prioritize and structure roadmaps, deciding what to build and when?
- Q1247: How would you approach creating a product roadmap without prior knowledge of the product?
- Q1285: How would you create a short-term roadmap when production issues, sales pressure, and customer demands conflict?
- Q1286: How would you create a three-year roadmap as head of product?
- Q1252: How would you approach product planning?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When structuring a roadmap, I use RICE to prioritize items, then organize them by time horizon. I list all roadmap items, score each using RICE (Impact × Confidence × Ease), and rank them. For short-term roadmap, I focus on high RICE items (quick wins, high impact). For medium-term, I include strategic items with medium RICE and dependencies. For long-term, I plan vision items (lower RICE but strategic). I communicate the roadmap structure clearly, explaining what's in each phase and why items are sequenced."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1137 (Prioritize and structure roadmaps):** Focus on structure → "To structure a roadmap, I'd list all items, score each using RICE, and rank them. I'd organize by time horizon: short-term (next quarter) = high RICE quick wins, medium-term (next 6 months) = strategic items with dependencies, long-term (1+ years) = vision items. I'd communicate the roadmap structure, what's in each phase, and why items are sequenced."

- **Q1247 (Create roadmap without product knowledge):** Emphasize discovery → "Without product knowledge, I'd first research: user needs, business goals, competitive landscape, technical constraints. Then I'd list candidate roadmap items, score using RICE (Impact based on user/business value, Confidence based on research, Ease based on technical feasibility), and rank them. I'd structure by time horizon and communicate assumptions and research gaps."

- **Q1285 (Short-term roadmap with conflicts):** Focus on conflict resolution → "With conflicting demands (production issues, sales, customers), I'd list all items, score using RICE, but weight Impact by urgency and business impact. Production issues blocking users = high Impact, sales pressure = medium Impact, customer demands = assess by value. I'd prioritize highest RICE items that address conflicts, communicate tradeoffs, and explain why some items wait."

### BUCKET 3: Resource-Constrained Prioritization
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Limited resources" or "Conflicting priorities" - same RICE framework, with resource constraints
- **Approach:** List options → Score RICE → Rank → Apply resource constraints → Decide what fits
- **Constraints:** Time (timeline cut), Budget (limited budget), People (few engineers), Scope (must deliver X)
- **Decision:** Highest RICE items that fit within constraints, communicate what's cut and why

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Timeline cut in half: Score options using RICE → Prioritize highest RICE items that fit timeline → Cut scope ruthlessly"
- "Limited budget: Score options using RICE → Prioritize highest RICE items within budget → Communicate what's cut"
- "Few engineers: Score options using RICE → Prioritize highest RICE items that fit capacity → Defer others"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q90: As a TPM, how would you handle a project with unchanged deliverables but a cut in the time period by half?
- Q1140: How do you prioritize strategic initiatives when resources are limited?
- Q1143: How do you prioritize when everything is urgent?
- Q1148: How do you set priorities with limited resources?
- Q2472: What would you do if you had to deliver a product or feature in half of the initial timeline?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When resources are constrained, I use RICE to prioritize, then apply constraints. I list all options, score each using RICE (Impact × Confidence × Ease), and rank them. Then I apply resource constraints (time, budget, people, scope) and select the highest RICE items that fit. I communicate what's included, what's cut, and why. The key is ruthless prioritization - cut scope, not quality."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q90 (Timeline cut in half):** Focus on timeline constraint → "With timeline cut in half, I'd list all deliverables, score using RICE, and rank them. I'd identify highest RICE items that fit the compressed timeline. I'd ruthlessly cut scope: remove nice-to-haves, simplify features, defer non-critical items. I'd communicate what's in scope, what's cut, and why. The goal is preserve core value, not everything."

- **Q1140 (Strategic initiatives with limited resources):** Emphasize strategic focus → "With limited resources, I'd list strategic initiatives, score using RICE (Impact = strategic value, Confidence = certainty, Ease = resource needs), and rank them. I'd prioritize highest RICE initiatives that fit resource constraints. I'd communicate what's funded, what's deferred, and why. Strategic alignment matters, but RICE helps make tough calls."

- **Q1143 (Everything is urgent):** Focus on urgency management → "When everything is urgent, I'd list all urgent items, score using RICE, but weight Impact by urgency and business impact. True emergencies (blocking users, revenue at risk) = high Impact. I'd rank by RICE and prioritize highest items. I'd communicate what's addressed first, what waits, and why. Not everything can be urgent - RICE helps cut through noise."

### BUCKET 4: Bug vs Feature / Tradeoff Prioritization
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Bug vs feature" or "Balance foundational work vs features" - RICE framework for tradeoffs
- **Approach:** List options (bug fixes, features, foundational work) → Score RICE → Rank → Decide tradeoff
- **Bug Fixes:** Impact = user impact (blocking vs minor), Confidence = 1.0 (known issue), Ease = varies
- **Features:** Impact = user/business value, Confidence = varies, Ease = varies
- **Foundational Work:** Impact = future leverage (compound value), Confidence = varies, Ease = usually low
- **Decision:** Highest RICE wins, but consider strategic importance and dependencies

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Bug blocking users: Impact 3 × Confidence 1.0 × Ease 2 = RICE 6.0 → Fix first"
- "Feature requested: Impact 2 × Confidence 0.7 × Ease 2 = RICE 2.8 → Build next"
- "Foundational work: Impact 3 × Confidence 1.0 × Ease 1 = RICE 3.0 → If it unlocks future features"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q1536: How would you prioritize between fixing a bug or shipping a new feature?
- Q1052: How do you balance engineering foundational work with building new features?
- Q1244: How would you approach a situation where your business users are pushing for a new business requirement and your engineering team has found 3 bugs, which are repetitive in nature?
- Q1144: How do you resolve conflicting product requirements, and who determines which requirement takes priority?
- Q1539: How would you prioritize multiple requests from different teams?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When prioritizing bugs vs features or tradeoffs, I use RICE to objectively compare. I list all options (bug fixes, features, foundational work), score each using RICE. For bugs: Impact = user impact (blocking = 3, minor = 1), Confidence = 1.0 (known issue), Ease = varies. For features: Impact = user/business value, Confidence = varies, Ease = varies. For foundational work: Impact = future leverage (compound value), Confidence = varies, Ease = usually low. I compute RICE and rank. Highest RICE wins, but I also consider strategic importance and dependencies. I communicate the decision and tradeoffs."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1536 (Bug vs feature):** Focus on comparison → "To prioritize bug vs feature, I'd score each using RICE. Bug: Impact = user impact (blocking users = 3, minor = 1), Confidence = 1.0 (known issue), Ease = fix complexity. Feature: Impact = user/business value, Confidence = data certainty, Ease = build effort. I'd compute RICE for each and compare. Generally, blocking bugs (high Impact) win, but high-value features with high RICE can take priority. I'd communicate the decision and why."

- **Q1052 (Foundational work vs features):** Emphasize balance → "To balance foundational work vs features, I'd score each using RICE. Foundational work: Impact = future leverage (compound value), Confidence = technical certainty, Ease = usually low (hard). Features: Impact = immediate user value, Confidence = varies, Ease = varies. Foundational work wins when Impact is high (unlocks multiple features) and Confidence is high. I'd prioritize highest RICE items, considering strategic importance. I'd communicate the balance and why foundational work matters when it compounds."
