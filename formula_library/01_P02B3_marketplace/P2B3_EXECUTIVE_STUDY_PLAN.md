# Executive Study Plan: P2B3 - Marketplace Metrics
**Approach:** GM-style, concept-level, business model-specific  
**Time:** 60-90 min  
**Source:** 7 questions → Business model-specific NSM + KPI Ladder

**❤️ = "Hedgehog Answer"** - Your fallback narrative if you know nothing. Master these first!

## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Marketplace Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Marketplaces are about **connecting supply and demand**. Metrics must capture both sides (supply = sellers/listings, demand = buyers/searches) and the health of transactions between them.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: supply (sellers/listings) + demand (buyers/searches)
- Transaction-based: revenue from successful matches
- Liquidity: need enough supply and demand to match
- Trust: both sides need to trust the platform

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Marketplace Products
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), Successful Transactions, Supply/Demand Balance
- **Key Insight:** GMV = total transaction value = best captures marketplace health
- **Input KPIs:** Supply (active listings, listing quality), Demand (searches, booking conversion), Marketplace Health (take rate, transaction success)
- **Leading Indicators:** New listing rate, Search-to-booking conversion, Seller onboarding completion
- **Guardrails:** Trust & safety, Listing quality, Price competitiveness

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Airbnb NSM: GMV (nights booked × price) - captures both supply and demand"
- "Etsy NSM: GMV (items sold × price) - measures marketplace transaction value"
- "Uber Eats NSM: GMV (orders × order value) - captures delivery marketplace"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Airbnb/Etsy/Uber Eats
- What metrics would you track for a marketplace?
- How would you measure marketplace health?
- What are the key metrics for a two-sided platform?
- How would you define success for a marketplace?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For marketplace products, the NSM is typically GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) - total transaction value. This captures both supply and demand sides. Input KPIs: supply side (active listings, listing quality score, seller satisfaction), demand side (search volume, booking conversion rate, repeat bookings), and marketplace health (take rate, supply/demand ratio, transaction success rate). Leading indicators: new listing rate, search-to-booking conversion, seller onboarding completion. Guardrails: trust & safety (prevent fraud), listing quality (maintain standards), and price competitiveness (stay competitive)."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for Airbnb:** Focus on accommodation → "For Airbnb, NSM: GMV (nights booked × average price). Input KPIs: supply (active listings, listing quality), demand (searches, booking conversion), marketplace health (take rate, supply/demand balance). Leading indicators: new listing rate, search-to-booking conversion. Guardrails: host satisfaction, guest safety, platform trust."

- **Measure marketplace health:** Emphasize balance → "Marketplace health is measured by supply/demand balance (ratio of listings to searches, optimal 1.2-1.5), take rate (platform revenue as % of GMV), and transaction success rate (% of bookings completed). Input KPIs: listing quality, search volume, booking conversion. Guardrails: trust & safety, listing quality, price competitiveness."

### BUCKET 2: Supply/Demand Balance Metrics
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Supply Metrics:** Active listings, listing quality score, seller satisfaction, seller retention
- **Demand Metrics:** Search volume, booking conversion, repeat bookings, user retention
- **Key Insight:** Balance is critical - too much supply = low prices, too little = low conversion
- **Measurement:** Supply/demand ratio, booking conversion rate, listing utilization

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Supply/demand ratio: active listings / searches - optimal around 1.2-1.5"
- "Booking conversion: bookings / searches - measures demand quality"
- "Listing utilization: bookings / listings - measures supply efficiency"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure supply/demand balance?
- What metrics indicate healthy marketplace?
- How would you improve listing quality?
- What's the relationship between supply and conversion?
- How do you prevent seller churn?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For supply/demand balance, I measure the ratio of active listings to searches (optimal 1.2-1.5), booking conversion rate (bookings/searches, target > 10%), and listing utilization (bookings/listings, target > 20%). Input KPIs: supply (active listings, listing quality, seller satisfaction), demand (search volume, user retention, repeat bookings). Leading indicators: new listing rate, search-to-booking conversion, seller onboarding completion. Guardrails: listing quality (maintain standards), seller satisfaction (prevent churn), price competitiveness (stay competitive)."

### BUCKET 3: Transaction & Trust Metrics
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Transaction Metrics:** Take rate, transaction success rate, average transaction value
- **Trust Metrics:** Review rate, dispute rate, fraud rate, safety incidents
- **Key Insight:** Trust enables transactions - measure both
- **Measurement:** Take rate (revenue/GMV), transaction success rate, review rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Take rate: platform revenue / GMV - measures monetization efficiency"
- "Transaction success rate: % of bookings completed - measures platform reliability"
- "Review rate: % of transactions reviewed - measures trust"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure transaction success?
- What metrics indicate platform trust?
- How would you improve take rate?
- What's the relationship between trust and transactions?
- How do you reduce fraud/disputes?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For transaction and trust metrics, I measure take rate (platform revenue/GMV, target 15-25%), transaction success rate (% completed, target > 95%), and review rate (% reviewed, target > 60%). Input KPIs: transaction volume, average transaction value, dispute rate, fraud rate. Leading indicators: first-transaction rate, review submission rate, dispute resolution time. Guardrails: trust & safety (prevent fraud), listing quality (maintain standards), platform reliability (ensure transactions complete)."
