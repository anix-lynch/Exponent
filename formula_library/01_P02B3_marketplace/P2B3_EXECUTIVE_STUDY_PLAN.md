## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Marketplace Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Marketplaces are about **connecting supply and demand**. Metrics must capture both sides (supply = sellers/listings, demand = buyers/searches) and the health of transactions between them.

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: supply (sellers/listings) + demand (buyers/searches)
- Transaction-based: revenue from successful matches
- Liquidity: need enough supply and demand to match
- Trust: both sides need to trust the platform

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Marketplace Products
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** GMV (Gross Merchandise Value), Successful Transactions, Supply/Demand Balance
- **Key Insight:** GMV = total transaction value = best captures marketplace health
- **Input KPIs:** Supply (active listings, listing quality), Demand (searches, booking conversion), Marketplace Health (take rate, transaction success)
- **Leading Indicators:** New listing rate, Search-to-booking conversion, Seller onboarding completion
- **Guardrails:** Trust & safety, Listing quality, Price competitiveness

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Airbnb NSM: GMV (nights booked × price) - captures both supply and demand"
- "Etsy NSM: GMV (items sold × price) - measures marketplace transaction value"
- "Uber Eats NSM: GMV (orders × order value) - captures delivery marketplace"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for Airbnb/Etsy/Uber Eats
- What metrics would you track for a marketplace?
- How would you measure marketplace health?
- What are the key metrics for a two-sided platform?
- How would you define success for a marketplace?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `NSM (GMV) → Supply KPIs → Demand KPIs → Marketplace Health → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For marketplace products, the NSM is typically GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) - total transaction value.

**1️⃣ NSM (GMV)** → Captures both supply and demand sides.

**2️⃣ Supply KPIs** → Active listings, listing quality score, seller satisfaction.

**3️⃣ Demand KPIs** → Search volume, booking conversion rate, repeat bookings.

**4️⃣ Marketplace Health** → Take rate, supply/demand ratio, transaction success rate.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Trust & safety (prevent fraud), listing quality (maintain standards), price competitiveness (stay competitive).

**Key Principle:** GMV = best captures marketplace health - it's the total transaction value.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for Airbnb:** Focus on accommodation
  - "NSM: GMV (nights booked × average price)"
  - "Input KPIs: supply (active listings, listing quality), demand (searches, booking conversion), marketplace health (take rate, supply/demand balance)"
  - "Leading indicators: new listing rate, search-to-booking conversion"
  - "Guardrails: host satisfaction, guest safety, platform trust"

- **Measure marketplace health:** Emphasize balance
  - "Supply/demand balance: ratio of listings to searches (optimal 1.2-1.5)"
  - "Take rate: platform revenue as % of GMV"
  - "Transaction success rate: % of bookings completed"
  - "Input KPIs: listing quality, search volume, booking conversion"
  - "Guardrails: trust & safety, listing quality, price competitiveness"

### BUCKET 2: Supply/Demand Balance Metrics
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Supply Metrics:** Active listings, listing quality score, seller satisfaction, seller retention
- **Demand Metrics:** Search volume, booking conversion, repeat bookings, user retention
- **Key Insight:** Balance is critical - too much supply = low prices, too little = low conversion
- **Measurement:** Supply/demand ratio, booking conversion rate, listing utilization

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Supply/demand ratio: active listings / searches - optimal around 1.2-1.5"
- "Booking conversion: bookings / searches - measures demand quality"
- "Listing utilization: bookings / listings - measures supply efficiency"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure supply/demand balance?
- What metrics indicate healthy marketplace?
- How would you improve listing quality?
- What's the relationship between supply and conversion?
- How do you prevent seller churn?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Supply/Demand Ratio → Conversion Rate → Listing Utilization → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For supply/demand balance, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ Supply/Demand Ratio** → Active listings / searches (optimal 1.2-1.5).

**2️⃣ Booking Conversion Rate** → Bookings / searches (target > 10%).

**3️⃣ Listing Utilization** → Bookings / listings (target > 20%).

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Supply (active listings, listing quality, seller satisfaction), demand (search volume, user retention, repeat bookings).

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Listing quality (maintain standards), seller satisfaction (prevent churn), price competitiveness (stay competitive).

**Key Principle:** Balance is critical - too much supply = low prices, too little = low conversion.

### BUCKET 3: Transaction & Trust Metrics
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Transaction Metrics:** Take rate, transaction success rate, average transaction value
- **Trust Metrics:** Review rate, dispute rate, fraud rate, safety incidents
- **Key Insight:** Trust enables transactions - measure both
- **Measurement:** Take rate (revenue/GMV), transaction success rate, review rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Take rate: platform revenue / GMV - measures monetization efficiency"
- "Transaction success rate: % of bookings completed - measures platform reliability"
- "Review rate: % of transactions reviewed - measures trust"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure transaction success?
- What metrics indicate platform trust?
- How would you improve take rate?
- What's the relationship between trust and transactions?
- How do you reduce fraud/disputes?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Take Rate → Transaction Success Rate → Review Rate → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For transaction and trust metrics, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ Take Rate** → Platform revenue / GMV (target 15-25%).

**2️⃣ Transaction Success Rate** → % completed (target > 95%).

**3️⃣ Review Rate** → % reviewed (target > 60%).

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Transaction volume, average transaction value, dispute rate, fraud rate.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Trust & safety (prevent fraud), listing quality (maintain standards), platform reliability (ensure transactions complete).

**Key Principle:** Trust enables transactions - measure both.

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2B3 (MARKETPLACE METRICS) QUESTIONS

**Look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Keywords:
- "Airbnb", "Etsy", "eBay", "marketplace", "two-sided platform", "GMV", "take rate"
- "supply and demand", "listings", "bookings", "transactions", "sellers", "buyers"

### Implicit Indicators:
- **Two-sided questions:** "metrics for marketplace", "supply and demand balance", "seller/buyer metrics"
- **Transaction questions:** "GMV", "transaction volume", "booking conversion", "listing quality"
- **Platform health:** "marketplace health", "liquidity", "trust and safety", "transaction success"

### P2B3 vs Other Patterns:
- **P2B3 (Marketplace):** "What metrics for Airbnb?" → Focus: GMV, supply/demand, transactions
- **P2 (General NSM):** "What metrics for product?" → Focus: Universal NSM framework
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Bookings down 25%" → Focus: Diagnose why metric dropped
