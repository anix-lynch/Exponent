## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P13C (DESIGN B2B / SAAS / ENTERPRISE) QUESTIONS

**Even when "B2B" or "enterprise" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit B2B Keywords:
- "B2B", "enterprise", "SaaS", "business", "workplace", "internal tool"
- "for companies", "for businesses", "for organizations"
- "workflow", "process", "automation", "productivity"

### Implicit P13C Indicators:
- **Enterprise focus:** "Design a B2B product", "Design for enterprise", "Design internal tool"
- **Workflow focus:** "Design product for [workflow]", "Design automation", "Design process tool"
- **Business context:** "Design for companies", "Design for businesses", "Design for organizations"
- **Adoption focus:** "Improve adoption", "Increase usage", "Workflow efficiency"

### P13C vs P13A Distinction:
- **P13C (B2B/SaaS):** "Design a B2B customer support product" → Focus: Enterprise workflow, User vs Buyer, Adoption Risks
- **P13A (Single-User Products):** "Design a better alarm clock" → Focus: Consumer product, single user

### P13C vs P13B Distinction:
- **P13C (B2B/SaaS):** "Design a B2B product" → Focus: Enterprise, workflow efficiency, adoption
- **P13B (Consumer Platforms):** "Design a social media app" → Focus: Consumer engagement, core loop

### P13C vs P13D Distinction:
- **P13C (B2B/SaaS):** "Design a B2B product" → Focus: Enterprise tool, workflow automation
- **P13D (Marketplace):** "Design a marketplace" → Focus: Two-sided platform, supply/demand

### Red Flags (NOT P13C):
- "Design a consumer app" → P13B (Consumer Platforms)
- "Design a marketplace" → P13D (Marketplace)
- "Design a physical product" → P13A (Single-User Products)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: B2B Product Design
**Questions:** ~5 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Design a B2B product" or "Design enterprise product" - core B2B design framework
- **Framework:** User vs Buyer → Workflow Pain → MVP → Adoption Risks → Success Metrics
- **User vs Buyer:** Who is the user? (End users - daily users, Administrators, Decision makers), Who is the buyer? (Procurement, IT/security, Executives)
- **Workflow Pain:** Current workflow problems (Inefficiencies, manual processes, integration gaps), Pain prioritization (Frequency, Impact, Cost)
- **MVP:** Minimum viable features (Core workflow automation, Critical integrations, Security/compliance), Phased rollout (Phase 1: Core features, Phase 2+: Advanced features)
- **Adoption Risks:** User adoption barriers (Change resistance, Learning curve, Workflow disruption), Mitigation strategies (Training, Gradual rollout, Support)
- **Success Metrics:** Adoption metrics (User activation, Feature adoption, Seat utilization), Business metrics (Time saved, Productivity gains, Retention - NRR)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Design B2B customer support: User vs Buyer (Users: Support agents, Buyers: Support managers, IT), Workflow Pain (Manual ticket routing, no integration, slow response), MVP (Core ticketing, basic routing, key integrations), Adoption Risks (Change resistance, training needed), Success Metrics (Ticket resolution time, agent satisfaction, NRR)"
- "Design employee onboarding: User vs Buyer (Users: New employees, HR, Buyers: HR managers, IT), Workflow Pain (Manual paperwork, no tracking, inconsistent), MVP (Core onboarding flow, document management, basic tracking), Adoption Risks (Change resistance, learning curve), Success Metrics (Onboarding time, completion rate, employee satisfaction)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q49: As a PM at Microsoft, design a B2B customer support product for them. (B2B product design angle)
- Q607: Design an employee onboarding product for SaaS companies. (HR product design angle)
- Q78: As a product manager at OpenAI, build an enterprise product. (enterprise product design angle)
- Q65: As a PM for JPMorgan Chase's Payments Developer Portal, design a new feature to improve customer adoption. (adoption-focused feature angle)
- Q66: As a PM for Mastercard, design a product for restaurants to switch to a purchase order system that reduces labor costs. (workflow automation angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `User vs Buyer → Workflow Pain → MVP → Adoption Risks → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When designing a B2B product, I use User vs Buyer → Workflow Pain → MVP → Adoption Risks → Success Metrics.

**1️⃣ User vs Buyer** → Who is the user? (End users - daily users, Administrators, Decision makers), Who is the buyer? (Procurement, IT/security, Executives) - they're often different.

**2️⃣ Workflow Pain** → Current workflow problems (Inefficiencies, manual processes, integration gaps), Prioritize by Frequency, Impact, and Cost.

**3️⃣ MVP** → Minimum viable features (Core workflow automation, Critical integrations, Security/compliance), Phased rollout (Phase 1: Core features, Phase 2+: Advanced features).

**4️⃣ Adoption Risks** → User adoption barriers (Change resistance, Learning curve, Workflow disruption), Mitigation strategies (Training, Gradual rollout, Support).

**5️⃣ Success Metrics** → Adoption metrics (User activation, Feature adoption, Seat utilization), Business metrics (Time saved, Productivity gains, Retention - NRR).

**Key Principle:** Design for users, sell to buyers. Focus on workflow efficiency and minimize change resistance.

### BUCKET 2: Adoption & Workflow
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Improve adoption" or "Workflow efficiency" - same framework, with focus on adoption
- **Approach:** Same B2B framework, with focus on adoption barriers and workflow optimization
- **Adoption Strategy:** Understand barriers (Change resistance, Learning curve, Workflow disruption), Mitigation (Training, Gradual rollout, Support, Clear value), Success metrics (Adoption rate, Feature usage, Time to value)
- **Workflow Optimization:** Identify inefficiencies (Manual processes, Bottlenecks, Integration gaps), Automate (Core workflows, Critical processes, High-impact areas), Measure (Time saved, Productivity gains, Error reduction)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Improve adoption: User vs Buyer (Map stakeholders), Workflow Pain (Identify what's blocking adoption), MVP (Features that drive adoption, integrations, training), Adoption Risks (Change resistance, learning curve), Mitigation (Training, support, clear value), Success Metrics (Adoption rate, feature usage)"
- "Workflow efficiency: Identify pain points (Manual work, bottlenecks), Automate (Core workflows, high-impact areas), Measure (Time saved, productivity gains)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q65: As a PM for JPMorgan Chase's Payments Developer Portal, design a new feature to improve customer adoption. (adoption-focused feature angle)
- Q66: As a PM for Mastercard, design a product for restaurants to switch to a purchase order system that reduces labor costs. (workflow automation angle)
- Q49: As a PM at Microsoft, design a B2B customer support product for them. (workflow efficiency angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `User vs Buyer → Workflow Pain → MVP (Adoption Focus) → Adoption Risks → Success Metrics`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When focusing on adoption and workflow, I use the same B2B framework but emphasize adoption barriers and workflow optimization.

**1️⃣ User vs Buyer** → Identify who needs to adopt.

**2️⃣ Workflow Pain** → Find what's blocking adoption or causing inefficiency.

**3️⃣ MVP (Adoption Focus)** → Features that drive adoption (Easy to use, clear value, integrations), Training and support built-in, Gradual rollout plan.

**4️⃣ Adoption Risks** → Change resistance (Address with clear value, training), Learning curve (Simplify, provide support), Workflow disruption (Minimize, provide alternatives).

**5️⃣ Success Metrics** → Adoption metrics (Adoption rate, feature usage, time to value), Workflow metrics (Time saved, productivity gains, error reduction).

**Key Principle:** Minimize change resistance and maximize workflow efficiency.
