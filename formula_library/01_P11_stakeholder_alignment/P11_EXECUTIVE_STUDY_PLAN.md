## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P11 (STAKEHOLDER ALIGNMENT) QUESTIONS

**Even when "stakeholder" or "alignment" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Stakeholder Keywords:
- "stakeholder", "alignment", "influence without authority", "cross-functional", "collaboration"
- "manage conflict", "resolve disagreement", "build consensus", "get buy-in"

### Implicit P11 Indicators:
- **Influence questions:** "how do you influence without authority?", "how do you convince stakeholders?"
- **Conflict questions:** "how do you manage conflict?", "resolve disagreement", "handle difficult stakeholder"
- **Collaboration questions:** "how do you work with engineering?", "cross-functional team", "bring teams together"
- **Alignment questions:** "how do you align stakeholders?", "ensure alignment", "get buy-in"
- **Team questions:** "how do you work with your team?", "build relationships", "build trust"

### P11 vs P10 Distinction:
- **P11 (Stakeholder Alignment):** "How do you align stakeholders?" → Focus: ALIGN stakeholders (Understand Incentives → Address Concerns → Build Coalition)
- **P10 (Executive Communication):** "How would you explain X to executives?" → Focus: COMMUNICATE clearly (Context → Insight → Recommendation)

### P11 vs P12 Distinction:
- **P11 (Stakeholder Alignment):** "How do you align stakeholders?" → Focus: ALIGN people (Understand Incentives → Build Coalition)
- **P12 (Operational Excellence):** "How do you ensure system reliability?" → Focus: OPERATIONAL health (Assess State → Identify Risks → Fix)

### Red Flags (NOT P11):
- "How would you explain X to executives?" → P10 (Executive Communication)
- "How do you ensure system reliability?" → P12 (Operational Excellence)
- "Revenue dropped 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Influence Without Authority
**Questions:** ~20 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "How do you influence without authority?" or "Get buy-in without power" - core alignment framework
- **Framework:** Understand Incentives → Address Concerns → Build Coalition → Decide
- **Understand Incentives:** Identify stakeholders (Exec, Product, Engineering, Legal/Ops/Sales), For each: Goal (what success looks like), Fear (what they're protecting against), Power (can block/influence/approve)
- **Address Concerns:** Map objections (Risk, Cost, Timeline, Ownership), Respond with specifics (Data where possible, Guardrails, Mitigations)
- **Build Coalition:** Secure early allies (influential but reasonable, cross-functional credibility), Sequence alignment (1:1s before group meetings, incorporate feedback visibly, let allies advocate publicly)
- **Decide:** Restate shared goal, Present aligned proposal, Call decision explicitly, Document + communicate outcome

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Influence without authority: Understand what each stakeholder cares about (Product: UX, Engineering: quality, Exec: growth), Address their concerns (guardrails, data, mitigations), Build coalition (align with influential stakeholders first), Decide (present aligned proposal)"
- "Get buy-in: Map stakeholder incentives, Address objections with data/guardrails, Build support through 1:1s, Make decision with alignment"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q209: Describe a situation where you had to influence without authority. (influence without authority angle)
- Q1117: How do you influence without authority? (general influence angle)
- Q7: A cross-functional team which your feature delivery is dependent on is not working at the expected pace. How would you handle this? (dependency management angle)
- Q208: Describe a situation where you encountered a problem that no one was willing to investigate because it was considered outside their scope. (scope expansion angle)
- Q2059: Tell me about a time you had to influence stakeholders without authority. (stakeholder influence angle)

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Understand Incentives → Address Concerns → Build Coalition → Decide`

**Memorizable Answer:**

When I need to influence without authority, I use Understand Incentives → Address Concerns → Build Coalition → Decide.

**1️⃣ Understand Incentives** → Identify all stakeholders (Exec, Product, Engineering, Legal/Ops/Sales), for each map:
  - **Goal:** What success looks like for them
  - **Fear:** What they're protecting against
  - **Power:** Can they block/influence/approve?

**2️⃣ Address Concerns** → Map objections (Risk, Cost, Timeline, Ownership), respond with specifics:
  - **Data:** Where possible
  - **Guardrails:** What we won't do
  - **Mitigations:** How risk is contained

**3️⃣ Build Coalition** → Secure early allies (influential but reasonable, cross-functional credibility), sequence alignment (1:1s before group meetings, incorporate feedback visibly, let allies advocate publicly).

**4️⃣ Decide** → Restate shared goal, present aligned proposal, call decision explicitly, document + communicate outcome.

**Key Principle:** Alignment ≠ consensus - it means no one is surprised and no one blocks.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q209 (Influence without authority situation):** Focus on behavioral example
  - "Describe situation: Get engineering to prioritize data quality fix"
  - "Understand incentives: Engineering's goal (shipping features), Fear (adding tech debt), Power (they could block)"
  - "Address concerns: Show data (data quality issues causing 10% of support tickets), Guardrails (minimal code changes, no feature delays), Mitigations (quick fix, automated tests)"
  - "Build coalition: Align with data science team first (they supported fix), then engineering lead (showed business impact), then product support (showed user impact)"
  - "Decide: Present aligned proposal in team meeting, get approval, document and communicate"
  - "Result: Engineering prioritized fix, data quality improved, support tickets decreased"

- **Q7 (Cross-functional team not working at expected pace):** Emphasize dependency management
  - "Understand incentives: Their goal (their own priorities), Fear (scope creep, timeline pressure), Power (they control delivery)"
  - "Address concerns: Show data (impact of delay on our feature), Guardrails (we won't change scope, we'll help if needed), Mitigations (we can adjust timeline, we can provide resources)"
  - "Build coalition: Align with their manager (show business impact), Get product support (show user impact), Involve my manager if needed (escalate appropriately)"
  - "Decide: Propose adjusted timeline or resource help, Get alignment, Document and communicate"
  - "Key: Understand their constraints, don't just push - find win-win"
