# P11 - Stakeholder Alignment

**Formula:** `Understand Incentives → Address Concerns → Build Coalition → Decide`

---

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
START: Teams disagree / decision is stuck
│
├─ 1) Understand Incentives (WHY each group cares)
│   │
│   ├─ Identify stakeholders
│   │   ├─ Exec
│   │   ├─ Product
│   │   ├─ Eng
│   │   ├─ Legal / Ops / Sales
│   │
│   └─ For each stakeholder
│       ├─ Goal (what success looks like for them)
│       ├─ Fear (what they're protecting against)
│       └─ Power (can block / influence / approve)
│
├─ 2) Address Concerns (REMOVE blockers)
│   │
│   ├─ Map objections
│   │   ├─ Risk
│   │   ├─ Cost
│   │   ├─ Timeline
│   │   └─ Ownership
│   │
│   └─ Respond with specifics
│       ├─ Data (where possible)
│       ├─ Guardrails (what we won't do)
│       └─ Mitigations (how risk is contained)
│
├─ 3) Build Coalition (CREATE momentum)
│   │
│   ├─ Secure early allies
│   │   ├─ Influential but reasonable
│   │   └─ Cross-functional credibility
│   │
│   └─ Sequence alignment
│       ├─ 1:1s before group meetings
│       ├─ Incorporate feedback visibly
│       └─ Let allies advocate publicly
│
└─ 4) Decide (MOVE forward)
    │
    ├─ Restate shared goal
    ├─ Present aligned proposal
    ├─ Call decision explicitly
    └─ Document + communicate outcome
```

## 🔑 Golden Rule

Alignment ≠ consensus.
Alignment = **no one is surprised, and no one blocks**.

## 📌 Sample: Ads Decision Stalled

**Question:**
"Stakeholders disagree on adding ads to a consumer product."

```
START: Ads decision is stalled
│
├─ 1) Understand Incentives
│   ├─ Product: user trust
│   ├─ Revenue: monetization
│   ├─ Legal: compliance risk
│   └─ Exec: growth narrative
│
├─ 2) Address Concerns
│   ├─ Product → ad caps + relevance rules
│   ├─ Legal → pre-review ad formats
│   ├─ Revenue → pilot with clear upside target
│   └─ Exec → success metrics + exit plan
│
├─ 3) Build Coalition
│   ├─ Align Product + Legal in 1:1s
│   ├─ Rev team supports pilot framing
│   └─ VP Product endorses proposal publicly
│
└─ 4) Decide
    ├─ Pilot ads in search only
    ├─ 90-day review checkpoint
    └─ Kill switch if trust metrics dip
```

## 📊 Stakeholder Map (Quick Fill)

```
Stakeholder | Goal | Fear | Power | Mitigation
------------------------------------------------
Product     | UX   | Trust loss | High | Guardrails
Revenue     | $$   | Missed growth | High | Pilot
Legal       | Safe | Compliance | Medium | Review
Exec        | Story| Risk | High | Clear metrics
```

## 💬 Language That Works

* "Here's what I heard you're worried about…"
* "What would make this safe enough to try?"
* "If we disagree, what data would change your mind?"

## 🔑 5-Second Recall

```
Who cares?
→ Why do they care?
→ What are they afraid of?
→ Who do I align first?
```
