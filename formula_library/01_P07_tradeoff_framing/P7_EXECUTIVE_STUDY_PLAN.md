## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P7 (TRADEOFF FRAMING) QUESTIONS

**Even when "tradeoff" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Tradeoff Keywords:
- "tradeoff", "trade-off", "balance", "decide between", "should we do X or Y?"
- "is it worth", "what are we giving up", "why not the other option"

### Implicit P7 Indicators:
- **Decision questions:** "should we do X?", "is X a good idea?", "would you recommend X?"
- **Balance questions:** "how do you balance X and Y?", "balance short-term vs long-term"
- **Build vs buy:** "build vs buy", "in-house vs partnership", "build vs partner"
- **User vs business:** "user experience vs revenue", "user wellbeing vs engagement"
- **Strategic decisions:** "should we enter market X?", "should we invest in Y?", "should we launch Z?"

### P7 vs P6 Distinction:
- **P7 (Tradeoff Framing):** "Should we do X or Y?" → Focus: FRAME tradeoffs (Winners/Losers/Guardrails)
- **P6 (Prioritization):** "Which features to build first?" → Focus: RANK options using RICE

### P7 vs P5 Distinction:
- **P7 (Tradeoff Framing):** "Should we enter market X?" → Focus: FRAME tradeoffs between options
- **P5 (Segmentation):** "Which users should we focus on?" → Focus: DEFINE segments

### P7 vs P1 Distinction:
- **P7 (Tradeoff Framing):** "Should we do X?" → Focus: FRAME decision tradeoffs
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Orders down 25%" → Focus: DIAGNOSE why metric dropped

### Red Flags (NOT P7):
- "Which features to build first?" → P6 (Prioritization)
- "Which users should we focus on?" → P5 (Segmentation)
- "Orders down 25%" → P1 (Metric Drop)

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Classic Feature/Product Tradeoffs
**Questions:** ~30 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Should we do X or Y?" or "Is X a good idea?" - core tradeoff framework
- **Framework:** Define Options → Winners/Losers → Guardrails → Decide + Communicate
- **Define Options:** List 2-3 clear options (Option A, Option B, Option C if needed)
- **Winners/Losers:** For each option, identify winners (Users, Business, Engineering/Ops, Long-term Strategy) and losers
- **Guardrails:** Non-negotiables (must not break X, must stay within Y, must protect Z)
- **Decide + Communicate:** Pick option, explain why, acknowledge what we're giving up, how we'll monitor risk

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Should Google Flights introduce ads? Option A: No Ads (Users win, Business loses revenue). Option B: Ads (Business wins revenue, Users lose UX). Guardrails: Must not bias rankings, must label ads. Decision: Introduce limited ads with guardrails."
- "Should we launch feature X? Option A: Launch (Users get value, Business gets engagement). Option B: Don't launch (Avoid risk, save resources). Guardrails: Must not break core experience. Decision: Launch with monitoring."

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q698: Determine if Google should introduce ads to Google Flights.
- Q701: Determine if we should launch a feature of Instagram Store that allows purchases without logging in.
- Q1314: How would you determine if Facebook Messenger should introduce group calling?
- Q1376: How would you help the Instagram team decide whether to launch the Rooms feature after a successful launch on Facebook?
- Q1797: Robinhood is planning to introduce a new feature which allows users to trade fractional shares. How would you decide whether this is a good idea or not?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When facing a feature or product decision, I frame it as a tradeoff. First, I define clear options (Option A, Option B, sometimes Option C). Then I identify winners and losers for each option across stakeholders: Users (better/worse experience), Business (revenue, growth, costs), Engineering/Ops (effort, complexity), and Long-term Strategy (strategic value, risks). Next, I establish guardrails - non-negotiables that must be protected (must not break core experience, must stay within constraints, must protect user trust). Finally, I decide on an option, explain why, acknowledge what we're giving up, and outline how we'll monitor risks."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q698 (Google Flights introduce ads):** Focus on ad introduction → "I'd frame this as a tradeoff between user experience and revenue. Option A: No Ads - Users win (clean UX, high trust), Business loses (missed revenue), Long-term Strategy wins (brand trust). Option B: Ads - Business wins (new revenue stream), Users lose (worse experience, bias risk), Long-term Strategy risks (trust erosion). Guardrails: Must not bias flight rankings, must clearly label ads, must cap ad density, must monitor user trust metrics. Decision: Introduce limited ads with guardrails. Rationale: Revenue value > UX cost if constrained properly. Tradeoff: Slight UX degradation. Monitoring: CTR, conversion, trust surveys."

- **Q701 (Instagram Store purchases without login):** Emphasize feature decision → "I'd frame this as a tradeoff between user convenience and security/data. Option A: Require login - Users lose (friction), Business wins (user data, security), Engineering wins (simpler auth). Option B: No login - Users win (convenience, faster checkout), Business loses (less user data, fraud risk), Engineering loses (complexity). Guardrails: Must protect payment security, must prevent fraud, must comply with regulations. Decision: Allow guest checkout with limited features. Rationale: Convenience drives conversion, but we protect security. Tradeoff: Less user data collection. Monitoring: Conversion rate, fraud rate, user data capture."

- **Q1314 (Facebook Messenger group calling):** Focus on feature addition → "I'd frame this as a tradeoff between feature value and complexity. Option A: Add group calling - Users win (new capability), Business wins (engagement, differentiation), Engineering loses (complexity, infrastructure). Option B: Don't add - Engineering wins (simpler), Users lose (missing feature), Business loses (competitive disadvantage). Guardrails: Must maintain call quality, must scale infrastructure, must protect privacy. Decision: Add group calling with phased rollout. Rationale: High user value, strategic importance. Tradeoff: Engineering complexity. Monitoring: Usage, quality metrics, infrastructure costs."

### BUCKET 2: Build vs Buy vs Partner Tradeoffs
**Questions:** ~10 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "Build vs buy vs partner" or "In-house vs partnership" - strategic decision tradeoffs
- **Framework:** Same tradeoff framework, applied to build/buy/partner decisions
- **Build:** Control, customization, but high cost, time, maintenance
- **Buy:** Speed, proven solution, but cost, less control, vendor dependency
- **Partner:** Speed, leverage, but dependency, revenue share, less control
- **Decision Factors:** Strategic importance, time to market, cost, control needs, core vs non-core

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Build vs buy payment solution: Build = control, customization, but high cost/time. Buy = speed, proven, but cost/dependency. Partner = speed, leverage, but dependency/revenue share. Decision: Partner if non-core, Build if strategic."
- "Build vs buy AI model: Build = control, customization, but high cost/time. Buy = speed, proven, but cost/dependency. Decision: Buy if non-core, Build if strategic differentiator."

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q151: Can you provide an example of a strategy you developed to address a technology gap at your company, and explain how you decided between build, buy, or partnership?
- Q1072: How do you decide between building a solution in-house or buying an existing one?
- Q1290: How would you decide between using an open-source model in-house versus a commercial API like OpenAI or Claude?
- Q1603: If Meta Pay did not exist, would you recommend that Meta develop its own payment solution internally or seek a partnership? Justify your decision.
- Q2289: What factors do you evaluate before deciding whether to build, fine-tune, or buy a generative AI model?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When deciding build vs buy vs partner, I frame it as a tradeoff between control, speed, and cost. Option A: Build - Winners: Control (customization, strategic control), Long-term Strategy (core competency). Losers: Time (slow), Cost (high), Engineering (effort). Option B: Buy - Winners: Speed (fast), Engineering (less effort), Business (proven solution). Losers: Cost (licensing), Control (less customization), Long-term Strategy (vendor dependency). Option C: Partner - Winners: Speed (fast), Business (leverage partner), Engineering (less effort). Losers: Control (dependency), Business (revenue share), Long-term Strategy (partner risk). Guardrails: Must protect strategic capabilities, must maintain quality, must manage dependencies. Decision: Build if strategic/core, Buy if non-core and proven, Partner if speed critical and non-core."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q1072 (Build vs buy solution):** Focus on general decision → "I'd frame this as a tradeoff between control, speed, and cost. Build: Control and customization win, but time and cost lose. Buy: Speed and proven solution win, but cost and dependency lose. Guardrails: Must protect strategic capabilities, must maintain quality. Decision: Build if strategic/core competency, Buy if non-core and proven solution exists. I'd evaluate: strategic importance, time to market, cost, control needs."

- **Q1603 (Meta Pay build vs partner):** Emphasize payment context → "For payment solution, I'd frame build vs partner. Build: Control and strategic value win (payment is core to Meta), but time and cost lose. Partner: Speed and leverage win, but control and strategic dependency lose. Guardrails: Must protect user data, must maintain security, must control user experience. Decision: Build internally. Rationale: Payment is strategic, control is critical, long-term value. Tradeoff: Higher initial cost and time. Monitoring: Build timeline, cost, security."

### BUCKET 3: User Experience vs Business Value Tradeoffs
**Questions:** ~15 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** "User experience vs revenue" or "User wellbeing vs engagement" - balancing user and business interests
- **Framework:** Same tradeoff framework, with focus on user vs business tradeoffs
- **User Experience:** Clean UX, privacy, wellbeing, but may reduce engagement/revenue
- **Business Value:** Revenue, engagement, growth, but may hurt UX/trust
- **Guardrails:** Must protect core user trust, must maintain minimum UX standards, must align with brand values
- **Decision:** Balance user and business, but prioritize user trust for long-term success

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Ads vs UX: More ads = more revenue, but worse UX. Fewer ads = better UX, but less revenue. Guardrails: Must not break core experience, must maintain trust. Decision: Optimize ad density to balance revenue and UX."
- "User wellbeing vs engagement: Reduce addictive features = better wellbeing, but lower engagement. Keep addictive features = higher engagement, but worse wellbeing. Guardrails: Must protect user health, must maintain brand values. Decision: Reduce addictive features with guardrails."

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q46: As a PM at Meta, how would you make users feel less guilty about using Instagram while also increasing revenue?
- Q79: As a Product Manager at TikTok, how would you address user concerns regarding the platform's algorithms being excessively addictive?
- Q1296: How would you define the optimal number of ads to show to users on Yelp?
- Q1639: Imagine you are a data scientist for Instagram. How would you balance ads and follower posts and how would you monitor its effectiveness.
- Q2552: Why did Instagram remove the like count on posts?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When balancing user experience and business value, I frame it as a tradeoff. Option A: Prioritize UX - Users win (better experience, trust), Business loses (revenue, engagement), Long-term Strategy wins (brand trust). Option B: Prioritize Business - Business wins (revenue, engagement), Users lose (worse experience, trust risk), Long-term Strategy risks (trust erosion). Guardrails: Must protect core user trust, must maintain minimum UX standards, must align with brand values. Decision: Balance both, but prioritize user trust for long-term success. Rationale: Short-term revenue gains don't justify long-term trust loss. Tradeoff: Optimize to maximize both, not maximize one at expense of other."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q46 (Instagram reduce guilt + increase revenue):** Focus on dual objective → "I'd frame this as balancing user wellbeing and revenue. Option A: Reduce guilt features (time limits, wellbeing tools) - Users win (less guilt, better wellbeing), Business loses (potentially lower engagement), Long-term Strategy wins (brand trust). Option B: Keep current - Business wins (current revenue), Users lose (guilt, addiction), Long-term Strategy risks (trust erosion). Guardrails: Must protect user wellbeing, must maintain brand values, must not significantly hurt revenue. Decision: Add wellbeing features (time limits, usage insights) while optimizing revenue through better targeting and value. Rationale: Wellbeing features can actually increase trust and long-term engagement. Tradeoff: Short-term engagement may dip, but long-term value increases."

- **Q1296 (Optimal ad density on Yelp):** Emphasize optimization → "I'd frame this as balancing user experience and revenue. Option A: Fewer ads - Users win (better UX), Business loses (less revenue). Option B: More ads - Business wins (more revenue), Users lose (worse UX, trust risk). Guardrails: Must not break core experience, must maintain trust, must clearly label ads. Decision: Optimize ad density through testing. Rationale: Find sweet spot that maximizes revenue without hurting UX. Tradeoff: Balance, not maximize one. Monitoring: Revenue per user, UX metrics, trust surveys."

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "When making strategic or investment decisions, I frame it as a tradeoff. Option A: Proceed - Business wins (opportunity, growth), Long-term Strategy wins (strategic value), but Business loses (resources, risk), Engineering loses (effort). Option B: Don't proceed - Business saves resources, Engineering saves effort, but Business loses (opportunity), Long-term Strategy loses (future value). Guardrails: Must align with strategic goals, must have resources, must manage risk. Decision: Proceed if strategic fit, resources available, and risk manageable. Rationale: Strategic value justifies investment if aligned. Tradeoff: Resource allocation and risk. Monitoring: Progress, ROI, risk indicators."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Q72 (Uber expand into Uber Eats):** Focus on market expansion → "I'd frame this as a tradeoff between focus and diversification. Option A: Expand to Eats - Business wins (new market, growth), Long-term Strategy wins (platform expansion), but Business loses (resources, focus), Engineering loses (complexity). Option B: Stay focused on rides - Business maintains focus, Engineering maintains simplicity, but Business loses (market opportunity), Long-term Strategy loses (platform potential). Guardrails: Must not hurt core rides business, must have resources, must manage complexity. Decision: Expand to Eats. Rationale: Leverages existing driver network, strategic platform play, manageable risk. Tradeoff: Resource allocation and complexity. Monitoring: Eats growth, rides impact, resource utilization."
