# P1 Micro Cheat Sheet

**Memorize this:**

```text
Clarify: what metric? what definition? what scope?
Data check: is it real?
Segment: where is it from?
Hypothesize: top 3 causes
Validate: quickest kill tests
Action: rollback / fix / experiment / communicate
```

**Quick Reference:**
- **Clarify:** Rate vs count? Scope (where/when/who)? Baseline + delta?
- **Data Check:** Instrumentation change? Timing/latency? Denominator weird?
- **Segment:** Platform, geo, cohort, funnel step, channel
- **Hypothesize:** Product change? External? Supply-side? Performance?
- **Validate:** Time correlation, counter-metrics, funnel localization, control segments
- **Action:** Rollback if severe, experiment if unclear, fix segment-specific, communicate
