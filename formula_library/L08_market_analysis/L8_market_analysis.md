# L8 - Market / Competitive Analysis

**Formula:** `Competitors → Differentiation → Market Conditions → Strategy`

---

## 🧠 Mental Model (ASCII Tree)

```
START: "What alternatives exist, and why do users choose them?"
│
├─ 1) Competitors (WHO are the alternatives?)
│   │
│   ├─ Direct
│   │   └─ Same user, same job
│   │
│   ├─ Indirect
│   │   └─ Different product, same job
│   │
│   └─ Status quo
│       └─ Excel, email, manual work, doing nothing
│
├─ 2) Differentiation (WHY do users pick each?)
│   │
│   ├─ Price
│   ├─ Quality / Performance
│   ├─ Convenience / UX
│   ├─ Trust / Brand
│   └─ Ecosystem / Lock-in
│
│   ⚠ Rule: Features don't differentiate — reasons do
│
├─ 3) Market Conditions (WHAT environment are we in?)
│   │
│   ├─ Market size & growth
│   ├─ Buyer vs seller power
│   ├─ Switching costs
│   ├─ Regulation / risk
│   └─ Network effects (yes/no)
│
├─ 4) Strategy (SO WHAT do we do?)
│   │
│   ├─ Compete head-on
│   ├─ Focus on niche
│   ├─ Undercut on cost
│   ├─ Differentiate on UX / trust
│   └─ Bundle / unbundle
│
└─ OUTPUT: Clear positioning + tradeoffs

## 📊 Canonical Table (Mental Model)

```

| Competitor B  | SMBs       | Cheap              | Limited  |
| Status Quo    | Everyone   | Familiar           | Manual   |

## 🚨 Anti-Patterns (Instant Red Flags)

```
✗ Listing features with no user reason
✗ Ignoring "doing nothing"
✗ Saying "we're better at everything"
✗ No explicit tradeoff
✗ No clear target segment
```

## 💬 One-Liners You Can Drop

* "The real competitor is often the status quo."
* "People don't buy features — they buy outcomes."
* "Strategy is choosing what not to compete on."
* "If there's no tradeoff, there's no strategy."
