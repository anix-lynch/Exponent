**Formula:** `Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails`

**Key Metrics:** Varies by product/feature context

General Metrics
│
├─ NSM (North Star Metric)
│   └─ Define based on product/feature
│       ├─ User value metric
│       ├─ Business value metric
│       └─ Alignment between them
│
├─ Input KPIs
│   ├─ User behavior drivers
│   ├─ Product quality drivers
│   └─ Business drivers
│
├─ Leading Indicators
│   ├─ Early engagement signals
│   ├─ Activation signals
│   └─ Quality proxies
│
└─ Guardrails
    ├─ User trust
    ├─ Long-term health
    └─ Cost / compliance
```

## 📌 Approach

For general metric questions without a specific business model:

1. **Understand the product/feature**: What does it do? Who uses it?
2. **Define NSM**: What single metric represents success?
3. **Identify drivers**: What moves the NSM?
4. **Set leading indicators**: Early signals of success
5. **Add guardrails**: What must not break?
