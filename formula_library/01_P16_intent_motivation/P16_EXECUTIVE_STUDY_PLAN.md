## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P16 (INTENT / MOTIVATION) QUESTIONS

**Even when "intent" or "motivation" isn't mentioned, look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Intent Keywords:
- "why do you want to work at", "why are you interested in", "what excites you about"
- "why this company", "why this role", "why now", "what attracts you"
- "mission", "values", "resonates", "motivation", "interest"

### Implicit P16 Indicators:
- **Company questions:** "Why do you want to work at X?", "Why are you interested in X company?"
- **Role questions:** "What excites you about this role?", "Why are you interested in this role?"
- **Mission questions:** "What part of our mission resonates with you?", "Which company values resonate?"
- **Timing questions:** "Why now?", "Why is this the right time?", "Why are you looking?"

### P16 vs P15A Distinction:
- **P16 (Intent/Motivation):** "Why do you want to work at X?" → Focus: Company, role, mission, personal fit, why now
- **P15A (Personal & Motivation):** "Why did you become a PM?" → Focus: Personal story, career choice, values

### P16 vs P15 Distinction:
- **P16 (Intent/Motivation):** "Why do you want to work at X?" → Focus: Future intent, company/role fit
- **P15 (Behavioral):** "Tell me about a time when..." → Focus: Past experience, STAR format

### Red Flags (NOT P16):
- "Tell me about a time when..." → P15 (Behavioral)
- "Why did you become a PM?" → P15A (Personal & Motivation)
- "How would you design X?" → P13 (Product Design)
