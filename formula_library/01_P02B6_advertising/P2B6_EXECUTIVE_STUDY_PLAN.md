## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Advertising Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Advertising products are about **balancing advertiser value (ROAS) and user experience**. Metrics must capture both advertiser outcomes (clicks, conversions) and platform health (user experience, ad quality).

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: advertisers (demand) + users (supply)
- Performance-based: advertisers pay for results (clicks, conversions)
- User experience: must balance ad load with revenue
- Quality matters: bad ads hurt both advertisers and users

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Advertising Products
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer, Advertiser ROAS, Platform Revenue per User
- **Key Insight:** Must balance advertiser value (ROAS) and user experience (ad load)
- **Input KPIs:** Performance (CTR, CPC, conversion rate), Ad Quality (relevance, targeting, fatigue), Inventory (impressions, fill rate, CPM)
- **Leading Indicators:** Ad engagement rate, View-through rate, Advertiser satisfaction
- **Guardrails:** User experience (ad load), Ad quality standards, Click fraud prevention

**Concrete Examples:**
- "YouTube Ads NSM: Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer - balances advertiser value + user experience"
- "Facebook Ads NSM: Advertiser ROAS - measures advertiser success"
- "Google Ads NSM: Platform Revenue per Search - measures monetization efficiency"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for an advertising platform
- What metrics would you track for ads?
- How would you measure ad success?
- What are the key metrics for advertising?
- How would you define success for an ad product?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For advertising products, the NSM is typically Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer - it balances advertiser value (revenue) and user experience (active viewers). Input KPIs: performance metrics (CTR, CPC, conversion rate), ad quality (relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad fatigue), and inventory (ad impressions, fill rate, CPM). Leading indicators: ad engagement rate, view-through rate, advertiser satisfaction. Guardrails: user experience (ad load must be acceptable), ad quality standards (must be relevant), and click fraud prevention (must be accurate). The key is balancing advertiser ROI with user experience."

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for advertising platform:** Focus on balance → "For advertising platform, NSM: Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer. Input KPIs: performance (CTR, CPC, conversion), quality (relevance, targeting), inventory (impressions, fill rate). Leading indicators: engagement rate, view-through rate. Guardrails: user experience (ad load), ad quality, fraud prevention."

- **Measure ad success:** Emphasize advertiser outcomes → "Ad success is measured by advertiser ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) and platform revenue. Input KPIs: CTR, CPC, conversion rate, CPM. Leading indicators: engagement rate, view-through rate. Guardrails: user experience (must not degrade), ad quality (must be relevant), advertiser satisfaction (must be positive)."

### BUCKET 2: Performance Metrics (CTR, CPC, ROAS)
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **CTR:** Click-Through Rate = clicks / impressions - measures ad relevance
- **CPC:** Cost Per Click - advertiser cost per click
- **ROAS:** Return on Ad Spend - revenue / ad spend, target > 3:1
- **Key Insight:** Higher CTR = better relevance, lower CPC = better efficiency, higher ROAS = better outcomes
- **Measurement:** CTR by ad format, CPC by targeting, ROAS by campaign

**Concrete Examples:**
- "CTR: clicks / impressions - measures ad relevance, target 1-3%"
- "CPC: cost per click - advertiser cost, lower is better"
- "ROAS: revenue / ad spend - advertiser ROI, target > 3:1"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure CTR?
- What is ROAS and why does it matter?
- How would you improve ad performance?
- What's the relationship between CTR and CPC?
- How do you measure conversion rate?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For performance metrics, I measure CTR (Click-Through Rate = clicks/impressions, target 1-3%), CPC (Cost Per Click, lower is better), and ROAS (Return on Ad Spend = revenue/ad spend, target > 3:1). Input KPIs: ad relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad format. Leading indicators: engagement rate, view-through rate, click quality. Guardrails: user experience (must not degrade), ad quality (must be relevant), advertiser satisfaction (must be positive). Higher CTR = better relevance, lower CPC = better efficiency, higher ROAS = better advertiser outcomes."

### BUCKET 3: Ad Quality & User Experience
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Quality Metrics:** Ad relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad fatigue rate
- **UX Metrics:** Ad load, skip rate, user complaints, engagement drop
- **Key Insight:** Quality ads = better performance + better UX - measure both
- **Measurement:** Relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad load %, skip rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Ad relevance score: how relevant ad is to user - measures quality"
- "Ad load: ads per content - measures UX impact, target 10-20%"
- "Skip rate: % of skippable ads skipped - measures relevance"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure ad quality?
- What metrics indicate good user experience?
- How would you improve ad relevance?
- What's the relationship between ad quality and performance?
- How do you prevent ad fatigue?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**
> "For ad quality and user experience, I measure ad relevance score (how relevant to user), targeting accuracy (right audience), and ad load (ads per content, target 10-20%). Input KPIs: relevance score, targeting accuracy, skip rate, user complaints. Leading indicators: engagement rate, view-through rate, user retention. Guardrails: ad load (must be acceptable), ad quality (must be relevant), user experience (must not degrade). Quality ads = better performance + better UX - they're not tradeoffs, they're aligned."
