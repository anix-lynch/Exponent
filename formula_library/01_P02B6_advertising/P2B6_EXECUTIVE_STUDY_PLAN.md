## 🎯 EXECUTIVE SCOPE (10-15 min)

### Why Advertising Metrics Matter

**Key Insight:** Advertising products are about **balancing advertiser value (ROAS) and user experience**. Metrics must capture both advertiser outcomes (clicks, conversions) and platform health (user experience, ad quality).

**Business Model Characteristics:**
- Two-sided: advertisers (demand) + users (supply)
- Performance-based: advertisers pay for results (clicks, conversions)
- User experience: must balance ad load with revenue
- Quality matters: bad ads hurt both advertisers and users

## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Define NSM for Advertising Products
**Questions:** ~3 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **NSM Options:** Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer, Advertiser ROAS, Platform Revenue per User
- **Key Insight:** Must balance advertiser value (ROAS) and user experience (ad load)
- **Input KPIs:** Performance (CTR, CPC, conversion rate), Ad Quality (relevance, targeting, fatigue), Inventory (impressions, fill rate, CPM)
- **Leading Indicators:** Ad engagement rate, View-through rate, Advertiser satisfaction
- **Guardrails:** User experience (ad load), Ad quality standards, Click fraud prevention

**Concrete Examples:**
- "YouTube Ads NSM: Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer - balances advertiser value + user experience"
- "Facebook Ads NSM: Advertiser ROAS - measures advertiser success"
- "Google Ads NSM: Platform Revenue per Search - measures monetization efficiency"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- Define NSM for an advertising platform
- What metrics would you track for ads?
- How would you measure ad success?
- What are the key metrics for advertising?
- How would you define success for an ad product?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `NSM → Performance KPIs → Ad Quality KPIs → Inventory KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For advertising products, the NSM is typically Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer - it balances advertiser value (revenue) and user experience (active viewers).

**1️⃣ NSM** → Balances advertiser value (revenue) and user experience (active viewers).

**2️⃣ Performance KPIs** → CTR, CPC, conversion rate.

**3️⃣ Ad Quality KPIs** → Relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad fatigue.

**4️⃣ Inventory KPIs** → Ad impressions, fill rate, CPM.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → User experience (ad load must be acceptable), ad quality standards (must be relevant), click fraud prevention (must be accurate).

**Key Principle:** Balance advertiser ROI with user experience - quality ads = better performance + better UX.

---

**How to Adapt This Narrative for Each Question:**

- **Define NSM for advertising platform:** Focus on balance
  - "NSM: Advertiser Revenue per Active Viewer"
  - "Input KPIs: performance (CTR, CPC, conversion), quality (relevance, targeting), inventory (impressions, fill rate)"
  - "Leading indicators: engagement rate, view-through rate"
  - "Guardrails: user experience (ad load), ad quality, fraud prevention"

- **Measure ad success:** Emphasize advertiser outcomes
  - "Success measured by: advertiser ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) + platform revenue"
  - "Input KPIs: CTR, CPC, conversion rate, CPM"
  - "Leading indicators: engagement rate, view-through rate"
  - "Guardrails: user experience (must not degrade), ad quality (must be relevant), advertiser satisfaction (must be positive)"

---

### BUCKET 2: Performance Metrics (CTR, CPC, ROAS)
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (High-yield)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **CTR:** Click-Through Rate = clicks / impressions - measures ad relevance
- **CPC:** Cost Per Click - advertiser cost per click
- **ROAS:** Return on Ad Spend - revenue / ad spend, target > 3:1
- **Key Insight:** Higher CTR = better relevance, lower CPC = better efficiency, higher ROAS = better outcomes
- **Measurement:** CTR by ad format, CPC by targeting, ROAS by campaign

**Concrete Examples:**
- "CTR: clicks / impressions - measures ad relevance, target 1-3%"
- "CPC: cost per click - advertiser cost, lower is better"
- "ROAS: revenue / ad spend - advertiser ROI, target > 3:1"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure CTR?
- What is ROAS and why does it matter?
- How would you improve ad performance?
- What's the relationship between CTR and CPC?
- How do you measure conversion rate?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `CTR → CPC → ROAS → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For performance metrics, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ CTR** → Click-Through Rate = clicks/impressions (target 1-3%).

**2️⃣ CPC** → Cost Per Click (lower is better).

**3️⃣ ROAS** → Return on Ad Spend = revenue/ad spend (target > 3:1).

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Ad relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad format.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → User experience (must not degrade), ad quality (must be relevant), advertiser satisfaction (must be positive).

**Key Principle:** Higher CTR = better relevance, lower CPC = better efficiency, higher ROAS = better advertiser outcomes.

### BUCKET 3: Ad Quality & User Experience
**Questions:** ~2 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Quality Metrics:** Ad relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad fatigue rate
- **UX Metrics:** Ad load, skip rate, user complaints, engagement drop
- **Key Insight:** Quality ads = better performance + better UX - measure both
- **Measurement:** Relevance score, targeting accuracy, ad load %, skip rate

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Ad relevance score: how relevant ad is to user - measures quality"
- "Ad load: ads per content - measures UX impact, target 10-20%"
- "Skip rate: % of skippable ads skipped - measures relevance"

**Representative Question Types (Do 5 only):**
- How do you measure ad quality?
- What metrics indicate good user experience?
- How would you improve ad relevance?
- What's the relationship between ad quality and performance?
- How do you prevent ad fatigue?

**❤️ Reusable Narrative (Base Story - Adapt for Each Question):**

**Framework:** `Ad Relevance → Targeting Accuracy → Ad Load → Input KPIs → Guardrails`

**Memorizable Answer:**

For ad quality and user experience, I measure three key metrics.

**1️⃣ Ad Relevance Score** → How relevant ad is to user.

**2️⃣ Targeting Accuracy** → Right audience.

**3️⃣ Ad Load** → Ads per content (target 10-20%).

**4️⃣ Input KPIs** → Relevance score, targeting accuracy, skip rate, user complaints.

**5️⃣ Guardrails** → Ad load (must be acceptable), ad quality (must be relevant), user experience (must not degrade).

**Key Principle:** Quality ads = better performance + better UX - they're not tradeoffs, they're aligned.

## 🔍 HOW TO IDENTIFY P2B6 (ADVERTISING METRICS) QUESTIONS

**Look for these keywords/phrases:**

### Explicit Keywords:
- "advertising", "ads", "CTR", "CPC", "ROAS", "CPM", "advertiser", "ad revenue"
- "click-through rate", "cost per click", "return on ad spend", "ad quality"

### Implicit Indicators:
- **Performance questions:** "how to measure ad success?", "improve CTR", "ad performance"
- **Revenue questions:** "advertiser revenue", "platform revenue", "ad monetization"
- **Quality questions:** "ad relevance", "targeting accuracy", "ad fatigue", "user experience"
- **Platform questions:** "YouTube ads", "Facebook ads", "Google ads", "ad platform metrics"

### P2B6 vs Other Patterns:
- **P2B6 (Advertising):** "What metrics for ad platform?" → Focus: CTR, ROAS, ad quality
- **P2 (General NSM):** "What metrics for product?" → Focus: Universal NSM framework
- **P1 (Metric Drop):** "Ad revenue down 25%" → Focus: Diagnose why metric dropped
