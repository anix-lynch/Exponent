## One-line PM framing (memorize this)

```
Success = Advertisers make money
        + Users stay happy
        + Inventory is efficiently monetized
        + Trust is preserved long-term
```

## Metric Categories Explained

### NSM (North Star Metric)

**Advertiser Value Created**
- **Advertiser ROAS**: Return on ad spend - do advertisers make money?
- **Long-term Advertiser Retention**: Do advertisers stay and grow spend?

**Why this works:**
- If advertisers don't make money, they leave → platform revenue drops
- Long-term retention = sustainable business model
- Aligns platform incentives with advertiser success

---

### Marketplace Health (Core)

**Platform-level metrics that show ecosystem health:**

- **Advertiser Spend Growth**: Are more advertisers spending more?
- **Publisher Revenue**: Are publishers (Google, partners) making money?
- **Auction Win Rate**: % of auctions where an ad is shown
- **Fill Rate**: % of eligible impressions that show ads (by channel: Search/Display/Video)

**Why these matter:**
- Healthy marketplace = growing on both supply and demand sides
- Win rate and fill rate show monetization efficiency

---

### Advertiser Performance (Demand-side)

**What advertisers care about:**

- **CTR**: Click-Through Rate - are ads relevant enough to get clicks?
- **CPC**: Cost Per Click - what does each click cost?
- **CPA**: Cost Per Action - what does each conversion cost?
- **Conversion Rate**: % of clicks that convert
- **ROAS / ROI**: Return on ad spend / investment

**Advertiser perspective:**
- These determine if advertising is profitable
- Platform must optimize these for advertiser retention

---

### Ad Quality & Relevance (Optimization Levers)

**Platform controls these to improve advertiser outcomes:**

- **Quality Score**: Google's composite score (relevance, CTR, landing page)
- **Ad Relevance**: How well ad matches query/intent
- **Landing Page Experience**: User experience after click
- **Ad Fatigue / Frequency**: How often same ad shown to same user

**Platform optimization:**
- Higher quality = better advertiser outcomes = higher bids = more revenue
- Quality Score directly impacts CPC (better quality = lower cost)

---

### Inventory & Monetization (Supply-side)

**Platform revenue drivers:**

- **Ad Impressions**: Total ads shown
- **CPM / RPM**: Cost/Revenue Per Mille (per 1000 impressions)
- **Query Coverage (Search)**: % of searches that have eligible ads
- **Ad Load**: Number of ads per page/session

**Platform perspective:**
- More impressions + higher CPM = more revenue
- But must balance with user experience (guardrails)

---

### User Experience (Guardrails)

**What must NOT break:**

- **Search Satisfaction**: Do users find what they need?
- **Ad-to-Organic Ratio**: Too many ads = poor UX
- **Latency**: Ads shouldn't slow down page load
- **Complaint / Policy Violation Rate**: User trust and safety

**Why guardrails matter:**
- Poor UX → users leave → less inventory → less revenue
- Trust violations → regulatory risk → business risk

---

### Leading Indicators

**Early signals of success:**

- **Advertiser Activation Rate**: % of new advertisers that get first conversion
- **Time-to-First-Conversion**: How quickly new advertisers see results
- **Budget Utilization**: Are advertisers spending their budgets?
- **Smart Bidding Adoption**: Are advertisers using automated tools?

**Why leading:**
- These predict future advertiser retention and spend growth
- Faster feedback loops than ROAS (which takes time to measure)

---

### Platform Trust & Safety

**Long-term sustainability:**

- **Click Fraud Rate**: Invalid clicks that waste advertiser money
- **Invalid Traffic %**: Bot traffic, accidental clicks
- **Policy Enforcement Accuracy**: Catching bad ads without false positives
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Meeting legal requirements (GDPR, etc.)

**Why critical:**
- Trust violations → advertiser churn → platform risk
- Regulatory issues → fines, restrictions, business shutdown

## Interview Application

**Use this structure to:**

1. **Define NSM first**: "Advertiser Value Created" (ROAS + retention)
2. **Show marketplace thinking**: Balance advertiser, user, and platform needs
3. **Separate layers**: NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails
4. **Explain tradeoffs**: More ads = more revenue, but hurts UX
5. **Demonstrate platform thinking**: Not just advertiser outcomes, but ecosystem health

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **NSM = Advertiser Value Created** - if advertisers don't make money, platform fails
2. **Marketplace health** - must grow both supply and demand
3. **Guardrails are critical** - user experience and trust cannot be sacrificed
4. **Leading indicators** - predict long-term success before ROAS is clear
5. **Platform vs Advertiser KPIs** - understand who owns what
