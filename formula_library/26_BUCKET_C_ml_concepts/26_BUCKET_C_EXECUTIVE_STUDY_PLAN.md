## 📊 CONCEPT BUCKET BREAKDOWN

### BUCKET 1: Overfitting & Model Reliability
**Questions:** 6 | **Salvageable:** 5 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (Master this)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **What:** Model memorizes training data, fails on new data → business metrics drop
- **Why it matters:** Shipping overfit models = wasted engineering time + bad user experience
- **3 Mitigation Levers:**
  1. More data (most effective, but expensive)
  2. Simpler model (reduce complexity)
  3. Regularization (L1/L2 - penalize complexity)
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** Balance between too simple (bias/underfitting) vs too complex (variance/overfitting)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "L2 regularization on logistic regression to reduce variance"
- "Cross-validation before shipping churn prediction model"
- "Monitor train/test gap - if train accuracy >> test accuracy, you're overfitting"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q812: Explain overfitting
- Q1049: How do you avoid overfitting a model?
- Q2324: What is overfitting or underfitting? Which models are most likely to experience this, and why?
- Q786: Explain bias-variance tradeoff
- Q816: Explain regularization

**Reusable Narrative:**
> "When I ship a model, I always check for overfitting because it's the #1 reason models fail in production. I split data into train/validation/test, and if validation accuracy is much lower than training, I know we're overfitting. My go-to fixes: first try more data, then simplify the model, and finally add L2 regularization. The goal is balancing bias and variance - too simple and we miss patterns, too complex and we memorize noise."

### BUCKET 2: LLM/GenAI Production & Safety
**Questions:** 5 | **Salvageable:** 2 | **Priority:** 🟢 GREEN (If you work with LLMs)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Hallucinations:** Model generates confident but false information → trust/legal risk
- **Mitigation:** Prompt engineering, RAG (retrieval-augmented generation), output validation
- **Safety:** Monitor hallucination rate, test on sensitive topics, have human-in-loop for critical decisions
- **Transformers:** Attention mechanism - model focuses on important parts (like reading key words)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Monitor hallucination rate for customer support chatbot - flag when confidence > threshold but answer is wrong"
- "Use RAG to ground LLM answers in company knowledge base, not just training data"
- "Test conversational AI on sensitive topics before deployment - catch overconfidence early"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q190: Define hallucinations in LLMs
- Q1372: How would you handle hallucinations in a generative AI model deployed to users?
- Q843: Explain transformers
- Q1653: Imagine you're part of a team deploying a conversational AI model that can reason across sensitive topics. During internal testing, you discovered that the model usually gives overly confident but...
- Q2390: What methods or metrics did you use to evaluate how well your LLM performs?

**Reusable Narrative:**
> "When deploying LLMs, hallucinations are the biggest risk - the model sounds confident but gives wrong answers. I handle this three ways: first, I use RAG to ground answers in our knowledge base. Second, I monitor hallucination rates in production and set alerts. Third, for sensitive topics, I always have human review. Transformers work by attention - they focus on the important parts of the input, which is why they're so powerful for language tasks."

### BUCKET 3: Model Evaluation & Monitoring
**Questions:** 5 | **Salvageable:** 1 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (High-yield but needs practice)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **Cross-Validation:** Split data, train on some, test on others, rotate to check robustness
- **Production Monitoring:** Track accuracy, latency, drift (data/model), business metrics
- **Testing:** A/B test new models, shadow mode before full rollout, canary deployments
- **Metrics:** Choose based on business goal (precision vs recall, F1, AUC-ROC)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Cross-validation before shipping churn model - use 5-fold CV to ensure it works across different data splits"
- "Monitor model drift - if input distribution changes, retrain or alert"
- "A/B test new recommendation model - measure both accuracy and business metrics (revenue, engagement)"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q789: Explain cross-validation and testing in logistic regression
- Q2393: What metrics do you monitor after deploying a machine learning model?
- Q1155: How do you test your machine learning models for production?
- Q2449: What testing methodologies are commonly used to ensure reliability and performance of AI models in production environments?
- Q2392: What metrics did you use to train and evaluate your models?

**Reusable Narrative:**
> "Before shipping any model, I use cross-validation to make sure it's robust - I split data into 5 folds, train on 4, test on 1, rotate, and check that performance is consistent. In production, I monitor three things: model accuracy (does it still work?), data drift (has input distribution changed?), and business metrics (is it actually helping?). I always A/B test new models and use shadow mode first - let the new model run alongside the old one without affecting users, then compare."

### BUCKET 4: Neural Networks Basics
**Questions:** 5 | **Salvageable:** 5 | **Priority:** 🟡 YELLOW (Only if relevant to your role)

**Board Slide Bullets:**
- **CNN vs RNN:** CNN = images/spatial patterns, RNN = sequences/time patterns
- **Deep vs Shallow:** Deep networks learn hierarchical features (edges → shapes → objects)
- **Vanishing Gradients:** Problem in deep networks where gradients get too small to update early layers
- **LSTM:** Special RNN that handles long sequences better (remembers important info, forgets noise)

**Concrete Examples:**
- "Use CNN for image classification - it detects spatial patterns like edges and shapes"
- "Use RNN/LSTM for time series or text - it processes sequences one step at a time"
- "Vanishing gradients occur in deep networks - early layers don't update, so we use techniques like batch normalization"

**Representative Questions (Do 5 only):**
- Q820: Explain the difference between Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
- Q1039: How do convolutional neural networks (CNNs) differ from traditional neural networks in processing image data?
- Q2617: Why is a deep neural network better than a shallow neural network?
- Q824: Explain the differences between LSTM and traditional neural networks
- Q2527: Where do vanishing gradients occur in a neural network?

**Reusable Narrative:**
> "I choose neural network architecture based on the problem. For images, I use CNNs because they're designed for spatial patterns - they detect edges, then shapes, then objects. For sequences like text or time series, I use RNNs or LSTMs because they process data step-by-step and remember context. Deep networks are better than shallow ones because they learn hierarchical features - but they can suffer from vanishing gradients, where early layers don't update properly."

### BUCKET 5: Deep ML Theory (SKIP FOR NOW)
**Questions:** 29 | **Salvageable:** 0 | **Priority:** 🔴 RED (Low impact)

**Examples:** BERT, auto-regression, cross entropy, gradient descent math, L1/L2 differences, etc.

**Decision:** These are "optionality" - only study if you have extra time or they come up in your specific role. Most are too technical for GM-level conversations.

## 🎤 REUSABLE NARRATIVES (Build 4-6 Stories)

### Story 1: "How I'd Ship a Model to Production Safely"
**Plug in:** Logistic regression, Random Forest, or simple CNN as example

> "When I ship a model, I follow a three-phase approach. First, I use cross-validation during development - split data into train/validation/test, and make sure validation performance is close to training (no overfitting). Second, I test in shadow mode - run the new model alongside the old one without affecting users, compare metrics. Third, I A/B test with a small percentage of users, monitor both model accuracy and business metrics. For example, when we shipped a churn prediction model using logistic regression, we caught overfitting early because validation accuracy was 10 points lower than training - we added L2 regularization and got them aligned."

### Story 2: "How I'd Handle Overfitting and Data Leakage"
**Plug in:** Any model type as example

> "Overfitting is the #1 reason models fail in production. I detect it by comparing train vs validation accuracy - if there's a big gap, we're overfitting. My mitigation strategy: first, try more data (most effective but expensive). Second, simplify the model - reduce features or use a simpler algorithm. Third, add regularization like L2. I also watch for data leakage - when test data accidentally influences training. I always check that features used in training are available at prediction time. For example, using future data to predict past events is a common mistake."

### Story 3: "How I'd Evaluate and Monitor an LLM Feature"
**Plug in:** Transformer/LLM as example

> "LLMs are powerful but risky - they can hallucinate, giving confident but wrong answers. When I deploy an LLM feature, I evaluate three things: accuracy (does it answer correctly?), hallucination rate (how often does it make things up?), and business impact (does it actually help users?). I use RAG to ground answers in our knowledge base, monitor hallucination rates in production, and for sensitive topics, I always have human review. For example, our customer support chatbot uses a transformer model with RAG - it pulls from our knowledge base instead of just training data, which reduces hallucinations by 40%."

### Story 4: "How I'd Choose Between Different ML Models"
**Plug in:** Logistic regression, Random Forest, CNN, RNN as examples

> "I choose models based on the problem type. For classification with tabular data, I start with logistic regression - it's simple, interpretable, and fast. If I need more accuracy and can trade interpretability, I use Random Forest. For images, I use CNNs because they're designed for spatial patterns. For sequences like text or time series, I use RNNs or LSTMs. The key is matching the model to the data structure and business requirements - sometimes a simpler model that's easier to debug is better than a complex one that's a black box."
