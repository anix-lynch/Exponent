# 🎯 Milestone Practice Guide

**Your 3 milestones to interview readiness**

---

## ✅ MILESTONE 1: Memorize 4 Pillars for Each Role

### Practice Method: "Say It Out Loud"

**For each role, practice saying:**

1. **The 4 pillar names** (with Thai descriptions)
2. **The thresholds** (Safe/Warning/Fucked)
3. **The impact** (what happens when it breaks)

### Daily Practice (5 minutes per role)

**Data Engineer:**
- Say: "DLTC - Duplication, Lateness, Time Travel, Canonical"
- Say: "Duplication < 2% safe, > 5% fucked"
- Say: "Impact: Revenue inflation, fake growth"

**ML Engineer:**
- Say: "DLPF - Data Leakage, Latency, Prediction, Feature"
- Say: "Data Leakage = 0% clean, > 2% cheating"
- Say: "Impact: Fake accuracy, production fails"

**GenAI Engineer:**
- Say: "HRCC - Hallucination, Retrieval, Context, Cost"
- Say: "Hallucination < 5% grounded, > 15% lying"
- Say: "Impact: Wrong answers, user loses trust"

**Data Scientist:**
- Say: "SBER - Statistical, Business, Experiment, Root"
- Say: "Statistical p < 0.01 rigorous, p > 0.05 not significant"
- Say: "Impact: Wrong conclusions, false discoveries"

**Data Analyst:**
- Say: "MMCS - Metric Mismatch, Missing Context, Correlation, Storytelling"
- Say: "Metric Mismatch = 1 heaven, ≥ 3 civil war"
- Say: "Impact: Teams fight, nobody trusts data"

### Test Yourself:
- Can you name all 4 pillars for each role?
- Can you say the thresholds?
- Can you explain the impact?

**✅ Milestone 1 Complete When:** You can recite all 5 roles' pillars without looking

## ✅ MILESTONE 2: Connect Portfolio to Pillars

### Practice Method: "Project → Pillar Mapping"

**For each project, practice saying:**

1. **Which project** (e.g., "In Mocktailverse...")
2. **Which pillar** (e.g., "...I demonstrate the Hallucination pillar...")
3. **How** (e.g., "...through RAG implementation...")
4. **Impact** (e.g., "...achieving < 5% hallucination rate...")

### Practice Examples:

**Mocktailverse → GenAI Pillars:**
- "In Mocktailverse, I demonstrate the Hallucination pillar through RAG implementation, achieving < 5% hallucination rate"
- "In Mocktailverse, I demonstrate the Retrieval Quality pillar through vector search optimization, achieving > 80% precision"
- "In Mocktailverse, I demonstrate the Context Window pillar through chunking strategy, keeping usage < 80%"
- "In Mocktailverse, I demonstrate the Cost Per Query pillar through optimization, achieving $1-2/month cost"

**Churn ML Pipeline → ML Pillars:**
- "In Churn ML Pipeline, I demonstrate the Data Leakage pillar through time-aware splitting, ensuring = 0% leakage"
- "In Churn ML Pipeline, I demonstrate the Model Drift pillar through monitoring, keeping drift < 5%"
- "In Churn ML Pipeline, I demonstrate the Prediction Latency pillar through FastAPI, achieving < 100ms"
- "In Churn ML Pipeline, I demonstrate the Feature Staleness pillar through feature engineering, keeping freshness < 1 min"

### Test Yourself:
- Can you map each project to its relevant pillars?
- Can you explain HOW each project demonstrates the pillar?
- Can you state the metrics/impact?

**✅ Milestone 2 Complete When:** You can connect any project to any relevant pillar

## ✅ MILESTONE 3: Write & Practice Resume Bullets

### Practice Method: "Tell Me About Gozeroshot.dev"

**For each role, practice this answer:**

1. **Opening**: "I built [project] to demonstrate..."
2. **Connect to pillars**: "This shows the 4 critical [role] pillars..."
3. **Show impact**: "Achieving [metrics]..."
4. **Tie to role**: "This demonstrates I understand what makes [role] systems production-ready..."

### Practice Scripts:

#### Data Engineer:
> "I built Coffeeverse and Cocktailverse to demonstrate the 4 critical Data Engineer pillars: preventing duplication (< 2% duplicate rate), ensuring data freshness (< 5 min latency), maintaining historical accuracy (SCD handling), and establishing single source of truth (star schema). This shows I understand what gets DEs fired and how to prevent it."

#### ML Engineer:
> "I built Churn ML Pipeline and Fraud Detection to demonstrate the 4 critical ML Engineer pillars: preventing data leakage (time-aware splitting), monitoring model drift (< 5% drift), optimizing prediction latency (< 100ms), and ensuring feature freshness (< 1 min). This shows I understand what breaks ML systems in production."

#### GenAI Engineer:
> "I built Mocktailverse, AI Agent Job Intelligence, and Multimodal GenAI Studio to demonstrate the 4 critical GenAI pillars: preventing hallucinations (< 5% rate through RAG), optimizing retrieval quality (> 80% precision), managing context windows (< 80% usage), and controlling costs ($1-2/month). This shows I understand what makes GenAI systems reliable and cost-effective."

#### Data Scientist:
> "I built Churn ML Pipeline and Marketing Analytics to demonstrate statistical rigor and business impact. I'm extending Marketing Analytics with A/B testing to show experiment design. My finance background helps me connect insights to business value, ensuring every analysis drives actionable decisions."

#### Data Analyst:
> "I built Marketing Analytics and Cocktailverse to demonstrate the 4 critical Data Analyst pillars: ensuring metric consistency (star schema), applying business context (finance background), distinguishing correlation from causation (root cause analysis), and connecting insights to actions (actionable recommendations). I don't just report numbers—I drive decisions."

### Test Yourself:
- Can you answer "Tell me about gozeroshot.dev" for each role?
- Can you connect projects to pillars in your answer?
- Can you state metrics and impact?
- Can you tie it to the role requirements?

**✅ Milestone 3 Complete When:** You can fluently explain your portfolio for any role
