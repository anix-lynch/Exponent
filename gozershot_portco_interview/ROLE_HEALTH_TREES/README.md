## 🎯 How to Use

### For Each Role:

1. **Understand the 4 pillars** - These are what get you fired
2. **Map questions to pillars** - Every question tests one of these
3. **Know the thresholds** - Safe vs Warning vs Fucked
4. **Understand the impact** - What happens when things break

### Example:

**Question**: "How do you handle duplicate records?"

**Pillar**: [1] DUPLICATION

**Intent**: Test if you understand data quality fundamentals

**Your Answer Should:**
- Show you understand business impact (revenue inflation)
- Demonstrate prevention strategy (idempotency)
- Know thresholds (< 2% safe, > 5% fucked)

## 🔥 The Pattern

Every role has 4 critical pillars. If ANY pillar breaks:
- You get fired
- Business loses money
- Trust is lost
- Systems break

**Your job in interviews**: Show you understand these pillars and can prevent failures.

## ✅ Portfolio Mapping

Each health tree shows:
- Which portfolio projects demonstrate each pillar
- What questions map to which pillar
- What you need to add (gaps)

**Use this to:**
- Understand why interviewers ask specific questions
- Connect your portfolio to role requirements
- Identify what to emphasize in answers
- Know what gaps to fill
