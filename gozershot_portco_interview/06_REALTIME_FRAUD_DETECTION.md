91. **I see you built Real-time Fraud Detection** ([github.com/anix-lynch/realtime-fraud-detection](https://github.com/anix-lynch/realtime-fraud-detection)) **with < 100ms latency**. How did you achieve that?
92. **In your Real-time Fraud Detection**, why did you choose statistical methods over ML models for real-time?
93. **Walk me through your real-time feature engineering approach in Fraud Detection.**
94. **In your Fraud Detection system**, how do you handle feature computation in sub-100ms?
95. **What's your strategy for handling false positives in your Fraud Detection?**
96. **In your Fraud Detection**, how do you handle system failures without blocking transactions?
97. **What monitoring do you have for fraud detection accuracy in your system?**
98. **How would you scale your Fraud Detection to handle 1M transactions per hour?**
99. **In your Fraud Detection**, what was your approach to threshold tuning?
100. **How do you handle concept drift in fraud patterns in your Fraud Detection system?**
