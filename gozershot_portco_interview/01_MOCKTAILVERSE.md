16. **I see you built Mocktailverse with AWS Bedrock RAG pipeline** ([github.com/anix-lynch/mocktailverse-bedrock](https://github.com/anix-lynch/mocktailverse-bedrock)). Walk me through your RAG pipeline architecture from end to end.
17. **In your Mocktailverse project**, why did you choose AWS Bedrock over OpenAI's API?
18. **Your Mocktailverse uses Titan Embeddings v2** - what embedding model did you use and why?
19. **In Mocktailverse**, how did you decide on chunk size for document processing?
20. **I see you used DynamoDB for vector search in Mocktailverse** - what vector database approach did you use and what were the trade-offs?
21. **In your Mocktailverse RAG system**, how do you handle document updates?
22. **For Mocktailverse's document ingestion**, what's your strategy for ensuring idempotency?
23. **In Mocktailverse**, how did you optimize vector search performance?
24. **Your Mocktailverse chunking strategy** - was it fixed size, semantic, or hybrid?
25. **In Mocktailverse**, how do you handle documents that are too large for a single chunk?
26. **For Mocktailverse**, what's your reranking strategy, if any?
27. **In Mocktailverse**, how do you manage context window limits when retrieving documents?
28. **What monitoring do you have in place for Mocktailverse's RAG pipeline?**
29. **In Mocktailverse**, how do you measure the quality of retrieved documents?
30. **What happens in Mocktailverse when a user query returns no relevant documents?**
31. **For Mocktailverse**, how did you handle costs for embedding generation at scale?
32. **In Mocktailverse**, what's your approach to handling different document types (PDF, markdown, etc.)?
33. **How do you ensure data privacy and security in Mocktailverse's RAG system?**
34. **What was the biggest challenge you faced building Mocktailverse?**
35. **If you were to rebuild Mocktailverse**, what would you do differently?
