## 🎯 How to Use These Bullets

### In Resume:
- Pick 3-4 bullets per role
- Tailor to job description
- Use metrics (50% cost reduction, < 5 min latency, etc.)

### In Interviews:
- When they ask "Tell me about gozeroshot.dev":
  1. **Name the project** (e.g., "I built Mocktailverse...")
  2. **Connect to the 4 pillars** (e.g., "which demonstrates the 4 critical GenAI pillars...")
  3. **Show impact** (e.g., "achieving < 5% hallucination rate and $1-2/month cost...")
  4. **Tie to role** (e.g., "This shows I understand what makes GenAI systems production-ready...")

### Example Answer:
> "I built Mocktailverse, an enterprise GenAI platform with RAG pipeline. This demonstrates the 4 critical GenAI pillars: I prevent hallucinations through RAG grounding (< 5% rate), optimize retrieval quality (> 80% precision), manage context windows (< 80% usage), and control costs ($1-2/month). This shows I understand what makes GenAI systems reliable and production-ready, not just technically impressive."
