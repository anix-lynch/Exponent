122,Assess a project's competitors.,🟡,L8,Market Analysis,Competitors → Differentiation → Market Conditions → Strategy,Competitive analysis; market assessment,"Competitors: Identify who the alternatives are. Direct: same user, same job (direct substitutes). Indirect: different product, same job (alternative solutions). Status quo: Excel, email, manual work, doing nothing. Remember: The real competitor is often the status quo. Map all options users have to solve their problem.

Differentiation: Understand why users choose each option. Price: cost, value proposition, pricing model. Quality / Performance: features, speed, accuracy, reliability. Convenience / UX: ease of use, time to value, user experience. Trust / Brand: reputation, security, established presence. Ecosystem / Lock-in: integrations, network effects, switching costs.

Switching costs: how easy/hard to switch, lock-in factors. Regulation / risk: compliance, legal constraints, regulatory environment. Network effects: yes/no, how strong, winner-take-all dynamics. Competitive intensity: number of players, barriers to entry, differentiation.

Undercut on cost: lower price, better value proposition. Differentiate on UX / trust: better experience, stronger brand. Bundle / unbundle: combine features or focus on core.
