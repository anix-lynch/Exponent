7,A cross-functional team which your feature delivery is dependent on is not working at the expected pace. How would you handle this?,🟢,P11,Stakeholder Alignment,Understand Incentives → Address Concerns → Build Coalition → Decide,Cross-functional dependency; influence without authority,"Understand Incentives: Identify why each stakeholder cares. Identify stakeholders: Exec, Product, Engineering, Legal/Ops/Sales, Users. For each stakeholder: Goal: what success looks like for them. Fear: what they're protecting against. Power: can they block, influence, or approve? Map their incentives to understand motivations and constraints.

Guardrails: what we won't do, boundaries we'll respect. Mitigations: how risk is contained, fallback plans. Language that works: 'Here's what I heard you're worried about...' 'What would make this safe enough to try?'

Build Coalition: Create momentum through strategic alignment. Secure early allies: Influential but reasonable stakeholders. Cross-functional credibility (people who can speak across teams). Sequence alignment: 1:1s before group meetings (address concerns privately first). Incorporate feedback visibly (show you're listening). Let allies advocate publicly (they champion the idea).

Decide: Move forward with alignment (not consensus). Restate shared goal: remind everyone what we're trying to achieve. Present aligned proposal: show how concerns were addressed. Call decision explicitly: make the decision clear, don't assume. Document + communicate outcome: ensure no one is surprised. Remember: Alignment ≠ consensus.

'What would make this safe enough to try?'

Build Coalition: Create momentum through strategic alignment. Secure early allies: Influential but reasonable stakeholders. Cross-functional credibility (people who can speak across teams). Sequence alignment: 1:1s before group meetings (address concerns privately first). Incorporate feedback visibly (show you're listening). Let allies advocate publicly (they champion the idea).

Decide: Move forward with alignment (not consensus). Restate shared goal: remind everyone what we're trying to achieve. Present aligned proposal: show how concerns were addressed. Call decision explicitly: make the decision clear, don't assume. Document + communicate outcome: ensure no one is surprised. Remember: Alignment ≠ consensus. Alignment = no one is surprised, and no one blocks."
