33,"As a Home Page PM at Netflix, how would you measure the success of your product?",🟢,P2B4,Subscription,Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails,Homepage success metrics,"Key metrics: Churn, LTV, MRR, retention, engagement, content consumption

NSM: Define one North Star metric that best represents user + business value. Example: Weekly Engaged Users or Time to Value.

Input KPIs: Break NSM into 3-5 controllable drivers. User behavior: sessions per user, click-through rate, time on page. Content quality: relevance score, engagement depth. Monetization: conversion rate, revenue per session.

Leading Indicators: Add early signals that predict NSM movement. Short-term behaviors: first-session actions, early engagement patterns. Funnel entry signals: activation rate, feature discovery. Quality proxies: user satisfaction, retention hooks, content signals.

Guardrails: Define what must NOT break while optimizing NSM. User trust, long-term health, cost/abuse prevention, compliance. Set thresholds that trigger alerts if breached.

Dashboard: Design simple monitoring structure. NSM at top (always visible, weekly trend). Input KPIs (weekly review, track drivers). Leading indicators (daily monitoring, early signals). Guardrails (alerts only, no daily noise)."
69,"As a PM for Spotify Podcasts, what success metrics would you define? If engagement on Spotify Music is down while engagement on Spotify Podcasts is up, what actions would you take?",🟢,P2B4,Subscription,Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails,Metric definition + tradeoff analysis; cannibalization,"Key metrics: Churn, LTV, MRR, retention, engagement, content consumption

Clarify: Define the metric (numerator/denominator), baseline, and scope. Specify: engagement = what exactly? Time window: when did it start? Magnitude: how significant?

Data Check: Rule out instrumentation changes, pipeline delays, or denominator shifts. Verify tracking accuracy, ETL lag, or event schema changes.

Segment: Slice by platform (iOS/Android/Web), geography, user cohort (new vs returning), content type, feature usage, and time of day to find engagement drivers.

Hypothesize: Product changes (UI, pricing, policy), external factors (competitor, seasonality), performance issues (latency, crashes), or supply-side changes (if marketplace).

Validate: Check correlation with launches, counter-metrics, funnel drop-offs, and compare to control segments. Look for crash rates, error codes, or performance degradation.

Action: If severe + clear cause → rollback/hotfix immediately. If unclear → add logging, run targeted experiments, or fix segment-specific issues. Communicate findings and mitigation plan."
