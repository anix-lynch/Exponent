Step 1: Search / browse listings. Step 2: View details / select option. Step 3: Enter booking info (dates, guests). Step 4: Review / payment. Step 5: Booking confirmed. Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions, not internal events.

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: confusing flow, too many steps, slow load time. Trust friction: unclear value, privacy concerns. Value friction: benefit not clear. Technical friction: bugs, latency, errors. Use session replays, funnel by segment, and qual research.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."
