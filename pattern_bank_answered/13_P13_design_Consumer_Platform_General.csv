13,A newly launched mobile app has a 25% drop-off during sign-up. How would you investigate the issue?,🟢,P13,Product Design,Users → Problems → Solutions → Tradeoffs → Risks → (Optional) Success Metrics,Sign-up funnel; 25% drop-off,"Define Funnel Steps: Map the exact user journey. Step 1: Entry (landing page / app open). Step 2: Start sign-up (click sign-up button). Step 3: Fill form (email, password, verification). Step 4: Complete sign-up (submit, verify email). Step 5: Activation (first action / onboarding complete). Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions, not internal events.

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: too many fields, confusing flow, slow load time. Trust friction: privacy concerns, unclear value. Technical friction: bugs, errors, mobile issues. Use session replays, funnel by segment (new vs returning), and qual research.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."
