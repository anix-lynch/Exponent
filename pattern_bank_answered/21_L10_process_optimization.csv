24,An amusement park has a ride with a long queue that is a growing concern. How would you address this issue?,🟡,L10,Process Optimization,Map Workflow → Identify Bottlenecks → Optimize → Measure,Queue = bottleneck; process optimization,"Map Workflow: Document the current process end-to-end. Identify all steps: from start to finish, map every stage. Sequence: order of operations, dependencies between steps. Stakeholders: who is involved at each step. Time: how long each step takes, total cycle time. Handoffs: where work transfers between people/systems. Create a visual flow: step 1 → step 2 → step 3 → completion.

Identify Bottlenecks: Find where the process slows down. Time analysis: which step takes longest? Wait time: where is work waiting (queues, approvals, dependencies)? Resource constraints: limited capacity, single-threaded steps. Rework: steps that require repetition, errors, corrections. Manual steps: human-dependent processes that could be automated. Dependencies: steps blocked by other processes or approvals. Focus on: highest time impact, most frequent delays, biggest pain points.

Optimize: Design improvements to eliminate bottlenecks. Increase capacity: add resources, parallel processing. Reduce demand: batch processing, off-peak scheduling. Optimize flow: reduce wait time, improve routing. Eliminate waste: remove unnecessary steps, streamline. Prioritize: focus on highest-impact bottlenecks first.

Measure: Track impact of optimizations. Before metrics: baseline cycle time, throughput, error rate. After metrics: improved cycle time, throughput, error rate. Key metrics: time saved, capacity increase, quality improvement. Continuous monitoring: track metrics over time, identify new bottlenecks. Iterate: if optimization didn't work, try different approach. Document learnings: what worked, what didn't, why."
