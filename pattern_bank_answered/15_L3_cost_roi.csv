3.1,What is the cost for a new Facebook customer acquisition?,🟡,L3,Cost / ROI,Cost Drivers → Benefits → Breakeven → Decide,CAC calculation; financial analysis,"Cost Drivers: Identify what we pay. Build cost: Eng time: people × weeks (engineering effort). Opportunity cost: what we don't build (tradeoffs). One-time infra setup: initial infrastructure investment. Run cost: Compute / storage / bandwidth: ongoing infrastructure costs. Third-party APIs: external service fees. Support & ops: operational overhead, maintenance. Risk cost: Reliability risk: potential downtime, service degradation. Compliance / legal: regulatory, legal exposure. Brand damage: reputation risk, user trust impact.

Benefits: Quantify what we gain. Revenue: New users: user acquisition, market expansion. Higher conversion: improved conversion rates. ARPU / LTV lift: average revenue per user, lifetime value increase. Cost savings: Automation: reduce manual work, operational efficiency. Infra reduction: lower infrastructure costs. Support deflection: fewer support tickets, self-service. Strategic: Learning: knowledge, insights, experimentation value. Moat / differentiation: competitive advantage. Risk reduction: mitigate existing risks.

Breakeven: Calculate when it pays back. Simple math: Monthly benefit: recurring value (revenue or savings). Monthly cost: ongoing operational costs. Payback period: build cost / monthly net benefit. Sensitivity: Best case: optimistic scenario (high adoption, high value). Base case: realistic scenario (expected outcomes). Worst case: pessimistic scenario (low adoption, high costs). Sanity checks: Unit economics (does usage scale cost?), Reversibility (can we undo this?), Fixed vs variable (what grows with scale?).

Decide: Choose path forward. Greenlight: Short payback: < 6-12 months typically acceptable. Asymmetric upside: high potential reward vs risk. Scope down: MVP first: build minimal version to test assumptions. Cheaper experiment: validate with lower investment. Kill / Defer: Long breakeven: payback period too long (> 18-24 months). High downside: significant risk, low confidence. Remember: ROI is not 'big upside.' It's 'good outcomes even if we're wrong.'"

1315,How would you determine if launching a new product is worthwhile?,🟢,L3,Cost / ROI,Cost Drivers → Benefits → Breakeven → Decide,Product launch decision; ROI analysis,"Define Funnel Steps: Map the exact user journey from entry to success. Identify 4-5 key steps: Entry → Activation → Core Action → Conversion → Success. Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions (not internal events or system metrics).

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: confusing flow, too many steps, slow load time. Trust friction: unclear value, privacy concerns. Value friction: benefit not clear. Technical friction: bugs, latency, errors. Use session replays, funnel by segment, and qual research.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."

Run cost: Compute / storage / bandwidth: ongoing infrastructure costs. Third-party APIs: external service fees. Support & ops: operational overhead, maintenance. Risk cost: Reliability risk: potential downtime, service degradation. Compliance / legal: regulatory, legal exposure. Brand damage: reputation risk, user trust impact.

Benefits: Quantify what we gain. Revenue: New users: user acquisition, market expansion. Higher conversion: improved conversion rates. ARPU / LTV lift: average revenue per user, lifetime value increase. Cost savings: Automation: reduce manual work, operational efficiency. Infra reduction: lower infrastructure costs. Support deflection: fewer support tickets, self-service. Strategic: Learning: knowledge, insights, experimentation value. Moat / differentiation: competitive advantage. Risk reduction: mitigate existing risks.

Breakeven: Calculate when it pays back. Simple math: Monthly benefit: recurring value (revenue or savings). Monthly cost: ongoing operational costs. Payback period: build cost / monthly net benefit. Sensitivity: Best case: optimistic scenario (high adoption, high value). Base case: realistic scenario (expected outcomes). Worst case: pessimistic scenario (low adoption, high costs). Sanity checks: Unit economics (does usage scale cost?), Reversibility (can we undo this?), Fixed vs variable (what grows with scale?).

Decide: Choose path forward. Greenlight: Short payback: < 6-12 months typically acceptable. Asymmetric upside: high potential reward vs risk. Scope down: MVP first: build minimal version to test assumptions. Cheaper experiment: validate with lower investment. Kill / Defer: Long breakeven: payback period too long (> 18-24 months). High downside: significant risk, low confidence. Remember: ROI is not 'big upside.' It's 'good outcomes even if we're wrong.'"

Scope down: MVP first: build minimal version to test assumptions. Cheaper experiment: validate with lower investment. Kill / Defer: Long breakeven: payback period too long (> 18-24 months). High downside: significant risk, low confidence. Remember: ROI is not 'big upside.' It's 'good outcomes even if we're wrong.'"
2783,You're a PM for a payment gateway with a $10 million extra budget for the next 1-1.5 years. Where would you invest it?,🟡,L3,Cost / ROI,Cost Drivers → Benefits → Breakeven → Decide,Cost/ROI analysis,"Cost Drivers: Identify what we pay. Build cost: Eng time: people × weeks (engineering effort). Opportunity cost: what we don't build (tradeoffs). One-time infra setup: initial infrastructure investment. Run cost: Compute / storage / bandwidth: ongoing infrastructure costs. Third-party APIs: external service fees. Support & ops: operational overhead, maintenance. Risk cost: Reliability risk: potential downtime, service degradation. Compliance / legal: regulatory, legal exposure. Brand damage: reputation risk, user trust impact.

Benefits: Quantify what we gain. Revenue: New users: user acquisition, market expansion. Higher conversion: improved conversion rates. ARPU / LTV lift: average revenue per user, lifetime value increase. Cost savings: Automation: reduce manual work, operational efficiency. Infra reduction: lower infrastructure costs. Support deflection: fewer support tickets, self-service. Strategic: Learning: knowledge, insights, experimentation value. Moat / differentiation: competitive advantage. Risk reduction: mitigate existing risks.

Breakeven: Calculate when it pays back. Simple math: Monthly benefit: recurring value (revenue or savings). Monthly cost: ongoing operational costs. Payback period: build cost / monthly net benefit. Sensitivity: Best case: optimistic scenario (high adoption, high value). Base case: realistic scenario (expected outcomes). Worst case: pessimistic scenario (low adoption, high costs). Sanity checks: Unit economics (does usage scale cost?), Reversibility (can we undo this?), Fixed vs variable (what grows with scale?).

2893,You’ve joined a program that has gone through many changes. How would you restructure it to get it back on track?,🟢,L3,Behavioral / Execution,Cost Drivers → Benefits → Breakeven → Decide,Metrics definition,"NSM: Identify the single most important metric that represents success. This should be the one number that best captures user value + business value combined.

Input KPIs: Break NSM into 3-5 controllable drivers. User behavior drivers (engagement, activation). Supply/quality drivers (content, inventory, features). Monetization drivers (conversion, retention, LTV).

Leading Indicators: Add early signals that predict NSM movement. Short-term behaviors: first-session actions, early engagement patterns. Funnel entry signals: activation rate, feature discovery. Quality proxies: user satisfaction, retention hooks, content signals.

Guardrails: Define what must NOT break while optimizing NSM. User trust, long-term health, cost/abuse prevention, compliance. Set thresholds that trigger alerts if breached.

Dashboard: Design simple monitoring structure. NSM at top (always visible, weekly trend). Input KPIs (weekly review, track drivers). Leading indicators (daily monitoring, early signals). Guardrails (alerts only, no daily noise)."
