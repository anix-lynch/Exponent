12,"A leading Canadian grocery chain is considering opening its first store in Montreal. Should they? If yes, what should be the ratio of self-checkout kiosks to cashier counters?",🟢,P9,Decision Under Uncertainty,Clarify Assumptions → Identify Risks → Validation Plan → Decide,Market entry decision; multiple unknowns,"Clarify Assumptions: Identify what we believe is true. User behavior assumptions: how will users react, what do they need? Market / demand assumptions: is there demand, what's the market size? Technical feasibility assumptions: can we build it, what are the constraints? Timing / dependency assumptions: when can we deliver, what dependencies exist? Classify assumptions: Critical (decision breaks if wrong) vs Non-critical (nice to know).

Identify Risks: Assess what happens if assumptions are wrong. If assumption is wrong, what happens? Revenue risk: financial impact, opportunity cost. User trust / UX risk: experience degradation, brand damage. Technical / scalability risk: performance, reliability issues. Legal / compliance risk: regulatory, legal exposure. Rank risks: High impact × high likelihood → MUST address. Low impact or low likelihood → monitor.

Validation Plan: Find cheapest signal to reduce uncertainty. What is the cheapest signal to reduce uncertainty? Qualitative: user interviews, expert review, stakeholder feedback. Quantitative: logs, metrics, small experiments, data analysis. Proxies: analogous products, historical data, competitor analysis. Time-boxed spike / prototype: build minimal version to test. Decide upfront: What result would change the decision? What result is 'good enough' to proceed?

Decide: Choose path forward with guardrails. Option A: Proceed now. If upside >> downside and risks are bounded. Option B: Delay and validate. If one critical unknown dominates. Option C: Kill / pivot. If downside is irreversible or catastrophic. Set clear criteria: what would make us change our decision?"
