286,Design a data pipeline that complies with GDPR.,🟡,L4,Constraints,Legal → Technical → Organizational → Timeline → Prioritize,Data pipeline; GDPR compliance,"Legal / Regulatory: Identify what we're not allowed to do. Compliance: GDPR / CCPA / HIPAA: data privacy regulations, consent requirements. Data residency: where data can be stored, processed. Consent requirements: explicit user consent for data usage. Contracts: Vendor terms: third-party service agreements, limitations. Partner SLAs: service level agreements, commitments. Licensing limits: software licenses, usage restrictions. Risk exposure: Fines / penalties: regulatory fines for non-compliance. Lawsuits: legal action, liability. Regulatory scrutiny: increased oversight, audits.

Technical: Identify what the system can't do today. Architecture: Legacy systems: old systems that are hard to change. Tight coupling: dependencies that limit flexibility. Data quality gaps: missing, incomplete, or unreliable data. Scale limits: Latency: response time constraints. Throughput: processing capacity limits. Reliability: uptime, error rate constraints. Dependencies: External APIs: third-party service availability, rate limits. Data availability: when data is available, freshness. Infra readiness: infrastructure capacity, capabilities.

Organizational: Identify who blocks or enables this. People: Hiring gaps: missing skills, headcount constraints. Specialized expertise: domain knowledge, technical skills. On-call ownership: who maintains and supports this. Incentives: Team OKRs misaligned: different priorities across teams. Competing priorities: other work takes precedence. Political resistance: organizational pushback. Process: Review cycles: approval processes, gate reviews. Approval chains: multiple stakeholders, sign-offs. Cross-team coordination: dependencies on other teams.

Timeline: Identify when this breaks. Fixed deadlines: Launch dates: product launch, feature release dates. Regulatory deadlines: compliance requirements, legal dates. Contract renewals: vendor contracts, partnership agreements. Sequencing: Must-do-first work: prerequisites, dependencies. Long-lead items: things that take time to prepare. Critical path: work that blocks everything else. Opportunity cost: What slips if this ships? Other work that gets delayed. What breaks if it's late? Consequences of delay.

Prioritize: Decide what to do about constraints. Hard constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE): Legal / safety: must comply, cannot compromise. External deadlines: fixed dates we can't change. Soft constraints (NEGOTIABLE): Scope: can reduce features, simplify. UX polish: can defer nice-to-haves. Internal tooling: can use workarounds. Strategy: Redesign to avoid constraint: change approach to work around limitation. Phase rollout: launch in stages, address constraints incrementally. Explicitly accept risk: acknowledge constraint and proceed with mitigation. Remember: Constraints are not excuses. They are design inputs. Good answers say what you'll trade, not just what you can't do."
