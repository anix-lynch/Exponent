Data Check: Rule out instrumentation changes, pipeline delays, or denominator shifts. Confirm measurement is accurate and not inflated by bots or data quality issues.

Segment: Slice by platform (iOS/Android/Web), geography, user cohort (new vs returning), funnel step, acquisition channel, and user segment to find the hot spot.

Hypothesize: Search relevance, pricing optimization, trust signals, supply quality, feature adoption, or user experience improvements.

Validate: Check correlation with launches, counter-metrics, funnel drop-offs, and test hypotheses with A/B tests or targeted experiments. Compare conversion rates by segment.

Action: Focus on highest-impact segments. Implement fixes: improve search/ranking, optimize pricing, add trust signals, or enhance UX. Measure impact and iterate."
