External: vendors, partners, scraped data, third-party APIs. Validate ownership: Who maintains it? Who is on-call when it breaks? Is there documentation / lineage? Can we trace the data flow?

Freshness: Check if data is up to date. Expected latency: Real-time: should update immediately. Hourly: should update within the hour. Daily / Batch: should update on schedule. Check gaps: Last updated timestamp: when was it last refreshed? Delays vs SLA: is it meeting expected update frequency? Silent failures: no alerts but stale data (check for missing updates).

Completeness: Verify nothing is missing. Coverage checks: Missing rows / days: are there gaps in the time series? Null or default-heavy fields: are key fields populated? Partial segments dropped: are all user segments / platforms included? Join loss: Inner joins removing data: are we losing records in joins? Key mismatches: do join keys align correctly? Upstream schema changes: did schema changes break data collection?

Bias: Check who is over- or under-represented. Sampling bias: Logged-in only: are we missing anonymous users? Power users: are we over-representing heavy users? Specific regions / platforms: are all geos and devices included? Measurement bias: Proxy ≠ true behavior: is our metric a good proxy for what we care about? Instrumentation gaps: are we tracking all relevant events? Incentives to game metrics: could users or teams be gaming the measurement?

Sanity Checks: Verify numbers pass the smell test. Trend checks: sharp jumps/drops that don't align with known changes. Ratio checks: conversion > 100%? Negative values where impossible? Cross-metric consistency: do related metrics move together logically? Compare to historical baselines: is this within expected range? Remember: No decision is better than a confident decision on bad data. If trust is low → slow down, qualify, or re-measure."
