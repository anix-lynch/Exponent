4,55% of users do not complete the application from the application page to the submission page. Why do you think this is the case?,🟢,P3,Funnel Analysis,Define Funnel Steps → Measure Drop-off → Identify Friction → Hypothesize Fix → Test,Application funnel; 55% drop = major friction,"Define Funnel Steps: Map the exact user journey. Step 1: View application page / start application. Step 2: Fill required fields (personal info, experience). Step 3: Review / upload documents. Step 4: Submit application. Step 5: Confirmation / next steps. Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions, not internal events.

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: too many required fields, unclear instructions, time-consuming. Trust friction: unclear process, privacy concerns. Technical friction: form errors, save issues, upload problems. Use session replays, funnel by segment, and form analytics.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."

Identify 4-5 key steps: Entry → Activation → Core Action → Conversion → Success. Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions (not internal events or system metrics).

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: confusing flow, too many steps, slow load time. Trust friction: unclear value, privacy concerns. Value friction: benefit not clear. Technical friction: bugs, latency, errors. Use session replays, funnel by segment, and qual research.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."

Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions, not internal events.

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: unexpected costs, forced account creation, complex forms. Trust friction: payment security, price shock, shipping delays. Technical friction: payment errors, mobile issues, slow checkout. Use session replays, funnel by device/platform, and error logs.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."

Guardrails: Define what must NOT break while optimizing NSM. User trust, long-term health, cost/abuse prevention, compliance. Set thresholds that trigger alerts if breached.

Dashboard: Design simple monitoring structure. NSM at top (always visible, weekly trend). Input KPIs (weekly review, track drivers). Leading indicators (daily monitoring, early signals). Guardrails (alerts only, no daily noise)."
2887,You’re a PM at CarGurus. You launched in Canada 8 months ago and conversions are lower in Canada than the US. What would you do?,🟢,P3,Funnel Analysis,Define Funnel → Drop-off → Diagnose Friction → Test Fix,Funnel analysis,"Define Funnel Steps: Map the exact user journey. Step 1: Product view / add to cart. Step 2: View cart / proceed to checkout. Step 3: Enter shipping / payment info. Step 4: Review order / confirm purchase. Step 5: Purchase complete / confirmation. Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions, not internal events.

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: unexpected costs, forced account creation, complex forms. Trust friction: payment security, price shock, shipping delays. Technical friction: payment errors, mobile issues, slow checkout. Use session replays, funnel by device/platform, and error logs.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."
2892,You’ve been asked to analyze the performance of a newly launched onboarding experience. What steps would you take?,🟢,P3,Funnel Analysis,Define Funnel → Drop-off → Diagnose Friction → Test Fix,Funnel analysis,"Define Funnel Steps: Map the exact user journey from entry to success. Identify 4-5 key steps: Entry → Activation → Core Action → Conversion → Success. Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions (not internal events or system metrics).

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: confusing flow, too many steps, slow load time. Trust friction: unclear value, privacy concerns. Value friction: benefit not clear. Technical friction: bugs, latency, errors. Use session replays, funnel by segment, and qual research.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.
