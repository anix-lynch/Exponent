1581,How would you use cohorts to identify retention issues?,🟢,P3,Funnel Analysis,Define Funnel Steps → Measure Drop-off → Identify Friction → Hypothesize Fix → Test,Cohort analysis; funnel analysis,"Define Funnel Steps: Map the exact user journey. Step 1: First use / activation. Step 2: Core value experience (complete key action). Step 3: Return within 7 days. Step 4: Return within 30 days. Step 5: Habit formation (weekly active). Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions, not internal events.

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: unclear value, confusing interface, slow performance. Value friction: not seeing benefit, lack of personalization. Technical friction: bugs, crashes, latency. Use session replays, cohort analysis, and user surveys.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."
