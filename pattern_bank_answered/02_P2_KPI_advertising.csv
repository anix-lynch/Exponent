What metrics would you use to track success in this area?",🟢,P2B6,Advertising,Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails,Content moderation metrics; ads compliance,"Key metrics: CTR, CPC, ROAS, conversion rate, ad quality, targeting accuracy

NSM: Identify the single most important metric that represents success. This should be the one number that best captures user value + business value combined.

Input KPIs: Break NSM into 3-5 controllable drivers. User behavior drivers (engagement, activation). Supply/quality drivers (content, inventory, features). Monetization drivers (conversion, retention, LTV).

Leading Indicators: Add early signals that predict NSM movement. Short-term behaviors: first-session actions, early engagement patterns. Funnel entry signals: activation rate, feature discovery. Quality proxies: user satisfaction, retention hooks, content signals.

Guardrails: Define what must NOT break while optimizing NSM. User trust, long-term health, cost/abuse prevention, compliance. Set thresholds that trigger alerts if breached.

Dashboard: Design simple monitoring structure. NSM at top (always visible, weekly trend). Input KPIs (weekly review, track drivers). Leading indicators (daily monitoring, early signals). Guardrails (alerts only, no daily noise)."
