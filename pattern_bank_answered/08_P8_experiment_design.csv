25,An engineer wants to make a major change to the ranking algorithm. How would you evaluate it?,🟢,P8,Experiment Design,Hypothesis → Metric → Design → Run → Validate → Decide,Algorithm change; A/B test evaluation,"Frame: Clarify decision and constraints. What decision are we making? (launch feature, change algorithm, run campaign, etc.) What constraints matter? (time, risk, traffic volume, legal, UX impact). Define success criteria upfront.

Hypothesis: State clear if-then-because. Format: If we change X for users Y, then outcome Z will change because R. X = treatment (what changes). Y = target population (who gets the change). Z = expected direction + size (if possible). R = mechanism (why it should work).

Metric: Define primary, guardrails, and diagnostics. Primary metric: the 'one number' for decision. Must map to goal (revenue, retention, activation, conversion, engagement). Guardrails: prevent self-own (quality, user harm, churn, latency, errors, complaints). Diagnostics: help explain why (step metrics, funnel steps, latency breakdown, CTR vs CVR).

Design: Make experiment valid and reliable. Unit of randomization: user vs session vs account vs geo vs device. Avoid spillover (users affecting each other). Population / eligibility: new users? returning? specific segment? Variants: Control vs Treatment (or A/B/C). Keep everything else constant. Duration & sample sizing: run full cycles (weekday/weekend). Ensure enough power for expected effect size. Instrumentation: event tracking, logging, exposure definition. 'Who saw treatment?' must be unambiguous.

Run: Execute with careful ramp and monitoring. Ramp: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% (if safe). Monitor guardrails daily. Freeze conflicting changes during test window. Track exposure and outcomes consistently.

Validate: Check result trustworthiness. A/A or sanity checks (if available). SRM check (sample ratio mismatch - traffic split correct?). Balance check (are groups comparable?). Correct attribution (exposure vs outcome window). Novelty / seasonality / logging changes. Multiple testing / peeking risk.

Decide: Ship, iterate, or rollback. If primary metric up and guardrails stable → ship with gradual rollout. If mixed results → iterate (refine treatment) and re-test. If guardrails worsen → rollback + root-cause analysis. Learnings: mechanism confirmed? which segment moved? Follow-up monitoring plan."

Metric: Define primary, guardrails, and diagnostics. Primary metric: the 'one number' for decision. Must map to goal (revenue, retention, activation, conversion, engagement).

Population / eligibility: new users? returning? specific segment? Variants: Control vs Treatment (or A/B/C). Keep everything else constant. Duration & sample sizing: run full cycles (weekday/weekend). Ensure enough power for expected effect size. Instrumentation: event tracking, logging, exposure definition.

Correct attribution (exposure vs outcome window). Novelty / seasonality / logging changes. Multiple testing / peeking risk.

Decide: Ship, iterate, or rollback. If primary metric up and guardrails stable → ship with gradual rollout. If mixed results → iterate (refine treatment) and re-test. If guardrails worsen → rollback + root-cause analysis. Learnings: mechanism confirmed? which segment moved? Follow-up monitoring plan."
2669,You are helping Netflix introduce an ACH payment method in the United States. What test would you conduct to help them determine whether ACH should be generally available?,🟢,P8,Experimentation,Hypothesis → Metric → Design → Run → Validate → Decide,Payment testing; experimentation,"Frame: Clarify decision and constraints. What decision are we making? (launch feature, change algorithm, run campaign, etc.) What constraints matter? (time, risk, traffic volume, legal, UX impact). Define success criteria upfront.

Hypothesis: State clear if-then-because. Format: If we change X for users Y, then outcome Z will change because R. X = treatment (what changes). Y = target population (who gets the change). Z = expected direction + size (if possible). R = mechanism (why it should work).

Metric: Define primary, guardrails, and diagnostics. Primary metric: the 'one number' for decision. Must map to goal (revenue, retention, activation, conversion, engagement). Guardrails: prevent self-own (quality, user harm, churn, latency, errors, complaints). Diagnostics: help explain why (step metrics, funnel steps, latency breakdown, CTR vs CVR).

Design: Make experiment valid and reliable. Unit of randomization: user vs session vs account vs geo vs device. Avoid spillover (users affecting each other). Population / eligibility: new users? returning? specific segment? Variants: Control vs Treatment (or A/B/C). Keep everything else constant. Duration & sample sizing: run full cycles (weekday/weekend). Ensure enough power for expected effect size. Instrumentation: event tracking, logging, exposure definition. 'Who saw treatment?' must be unambiguous.

Run: Execute with careful ramp and monitoring. Ramp: 1% → 10% → 50% → 100% (if safe). Monitor guardrails daily. Freeze conflicting changes during test window. Track exposure and outcomes consistently.

Validate: Check result trustworthiness. A/A or sanity checks (if available). SRM check (sample ratio mismatch - traffic split correct?). Balance check (are groups comparable?). Correct attribution (exposure vs outcome window). Novelty / seasonality / logging changes. Multiple testing / peeking risk.

Decide: Ship, iterate, or rollback. If primary metric up and guardrails stable → ship with gradual rollout. If mixed results → iterate (refine treatment) and re-test. If guardrails worsen → rollback + root-cause analysis. Learnings: mechanism confirmed? which segment moved? Follow-up monitoring plan."
