Data Check: Rule out instrumentation changes, pipeline delays, or denominator shifts. Ensure data quality and measurement consistency.

Segment: Slice by platform (iOS/Android/Web), geography, user cohort (new vs returning), content type, feature usage, and time of day to find engagement drivers.

Hypothesize: Top 3-5 potential causes ranked by likelihood × impact. Consider product, user, market, and technical factors.

Validate: Check correlation with launches, counter-metrics, funnel drop-offs, and analyze user behavior patterns. Use session replays, surveys, or log analysis.

Action: Prioritize fixes by impact × confidence. Start with data issues, then high-impact hypotheses. Run experiments, monitor results, and communicate plan."
