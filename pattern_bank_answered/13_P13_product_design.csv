Input KPIs: Break NSM into 3-5 controllable drivers. Resolution: first-contact resolution, time to resolve. Quality: customer satisfaction, issue recurrence. Efficiency: tickets per agent, automation rate.

Leading Indicators: Add early signals that predict NSM movement. Short-term behaviors: first-session actions, early engagement patterns. Funnel entry signals: activation rate, feature discovery. Quality proxies: user satisfaction, retention hooks, content signals.

Guardrails: Define what must NOT break while optimizing NSM. User trust, long-term health, cost/abuse prevention, compliance. Set thresholds that trigger alerts if breached.

Dashboard: Design simple monitoring structure. NSM at top (always visible, weekly trend). Input KPIs (weekly review, track drivers). Leading indicators (daily monitoring, early signals). Guardrails (alerts only, no daily noise).",P13B_Digital_Consumer

Add retention hooks (email, push, content) for late churn. Measure cohort again to validate improvements.",
