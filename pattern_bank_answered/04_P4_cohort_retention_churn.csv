82,"As a Product Manager for Clickup, analyze the scenario of low return rate of new users and propose solutions to improve metrics such as return rate, average new user sign-up, and daily average usag...",🟢,P4,Cohort / Retention / Churn,Retention Curves → Usage Frequency → Habit Loop → Fix,Retention problem; new user churn,"Define Cohorts: Group users by meaningful dimensions. By signup time: week/month cohorts to track lifecycle. By acquisition source: ads vs organic vs referral to identify quality differences. By persona: power users vs casual users vs new users. By behavior: activated vs not activated, feature adopters vs non-adopters.

Measure Retention: Build retention curve and compare cohorts. Track: D1 (day 1), D7 (week 1), D30 (month 1), W4 (week 4), M3 (month 3) retention. Compare cohorts side-by-side to spot differences. Assess: absolute level (how low is retention?) and shape (early cliff vs slow decay).

Identify Churn Drivers: Understand WHEN, WHO, and WHAT. WHEN: Day 0-1 churn → onboarding/activation problem. Week 1 churn → value not clear. Month 1+ churn → habit/competition issue. WHO: Which segments leave more? Specific cohorts, channels, or user types? WHAT: What changes before churn? Drop in key actions, fewer sessions, feature not used, or usage pattern shift.

Hypothesize: Generate hypotheses based on churn timing and patterns. If users churn early (Day 0-1) → activation gap, onboarding friction. If one cohort worse → acquisition mismatch, targeting issue. If usage drops first → value erosion, core loop not engaging. If late churn (Month 1+) → lack of habit, missing retention hooks.

Fix: Implement targeted solutions based on hypotheses. Improve onboarding/activation: simplify first experience, show value faster, reduce friction. Tighten targeting: improve acquisition quality, align messaging with product value. Reinforce core value loop: ensure users complete key action early. Add retention hooks: email, push notifications, content recommendations. Measure cohort again: track if retention curve improved for next cohort.",P4B_Retention
