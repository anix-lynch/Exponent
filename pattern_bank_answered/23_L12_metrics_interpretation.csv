144,"Can a university have a lower overall acceptance rate for female-identifying students, even if every department admits them at a higher rate than others?",🟡,L12,Metrics Interpretation,Metric Moved → Proxy Validity → Gaming Risk → Decide,Simpson's paradox; metric interpretation,"📊 Metric Moved: Identify what exactly changed
  📈 Direction: up / down / flat, which direction did the metric move?
  📏 Magnitude: small blip vs step-change, how significant is the change?
  🎯 Scope: which segment, surface, cohort, where is the change happening?
  ⏰ Time: one day spike vs sustained trend, is this temporary or ongoing?
  🔀 Aggregation level: overall metric vs segment-level metrics, check for Simpson's paradox
  ⚠️ Rule: Never react to a single datapoint

🔍 Proxy Validity: Verify if this metric means what we think it means
  🎯 Is it a proxy or the real goal? Is this metric a stand-in for something else, or the actual outcome?
  📈 How tightly correlated to value? Does this metric actually predict business value or user satisfaction?
  ⏭️ Leading vs lagging? Is this a leading indicator (predicts future) or lagging indicator (reflects past)?
  👁️ Any known blind spots? Are there scenarios where this metric is misleading or incomplete?
  ⚠️ Example: CTR ↑ but satisfaction ↓ → weak proxy

🎮 Gaming & Incentives: Assess if the metric can be manipulated
  👥 By users? Spam, bots, churn masking, are users gaming the system?
  👔 By teams? Optimize metric, hurt product, are teams optimizing for the metric at the expense of real value?
  🎨 By design? Dark patterns, forced clicks, is the product design encouraging manipulation?
  📊 By reporting? Definition drift, are we changing how we measure this over time?
  ⚠️ Rule: If it's tied to goals/bonuses, it WILL be gamed

🔍 Context Checks: Determine if this change is causal or coincidental
  📅 Seasonality? Is this a seasonal pattern we've seen before?
  🚀 Launches / experiments? Did we recently launch a feature or run an experiment?
  🌍 External events? Are there external factors (news, holidays, market changes) affecting this?
  🔧 Data pipeline issues? Could this be a data quality problem or reporting error?
  🔀 Aggregation bias? Is the overall metric hiding important segment-level differences (Simpson's paradox)?
  ⚠️ Correlation vs causation: is this change actually caused by what we think, or just correlated?

✅ Decide: Determine the appropriate action based on the analysis
  🚫 Ignore → noise or bad proxy: if the metric is misleading or the change is insignificant, ignore it
  👀 Monitor → unclear, need more data: if we're not sure, set up monitoring and wait for more information
  🔍 Investigate → signal but ambiguous: if there's a potential signal, dig deeper to understand what's happening
  ⚡ Act → strong signal + aligned proxy: if the metric is a good proxy and the change is significant, take action
  💡 Output: 'We believe X changed because Y, so we will Z.'"
