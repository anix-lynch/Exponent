Assume Waymo does not exist.",🟢,P5,Segmentation,(Persona × Behavior × Value) → Rank → Focus Top Segments,Market segmentation; geographic expansion,"Define Personas (WHO): Identify distinct user groups. Demographics: age, role, company size, geographic region. Context: job-to-be-done, use case, environment. Needs and constraints: what they need, what limits them.

Define Behaviors (HOW): Map how users interact. Frequency: daily vs weekly vs occasional usage patterns. Depth: light users (basic features) vs power users (advanced features). Lifecycle stage: new users vs active users vs mature users. Usage patterns: feature adoption, session length, return frequency.

Define Value (WHY THEY MATTER): Quantify segment importance. Revenue: ARPU, LTV, conversion rate, retention. Strategic value: growth potential, network effects, market position. Cost/risk: support cost, churn risk, acquisition cost.
