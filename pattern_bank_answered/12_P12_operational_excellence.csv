Baseline health: Availability: uptime, error rates. Performance: latency, throughput. Quality: bugs, data correctness. Operations: on-call load, manual work.

Identify Risks: Enumerate what could break. Enumerate failure modes: Technical: scaling issues, dependencies, infrastructure. Data: freshness, correctness, completeness. Process: handoffs, approvals, manual steps. People: bus factor, burnout, knowledge gaps. For each risk: Likelihood: how probable is this failure? Impact: blast radius (how many users/features affected). Detection difficulty: how fast would we notice?

Define scope: Product / system boundaries: what's in scope, what's out. Owners: who's on-call / accountable. SLAs / expectations: what are the performance targets? Baseline health: Availability: uptime, error rates. Performance: latency, throughput. Quality: bugs, data correctness. Operations: on-call load, manual work.

Identify Risks: Enumerate what could break. Enumerate failure modes: Technical: scaling issues, dependencies, infrastructure. Data: freshness, correctness, completeness. Process: handoffs, approvals, manual steps. People: bus factor, burnout, knowledge gaps. For each risk: Likelihood: how probable is this failure? Impact: blast radius (how many users/features affected). Detection difficulty: how fast would we notice?

Prioritize Fixes: Rank and choose actions. Rank risks by: Impact × Likelihood (high priority = high impact × high likelihood). Time-to-detect × Time-to-recover (faster detection/recovery = better). Choose actions: Prevent: design changes, architecture improvements, automation. Detect: metrics, alerts, monitoring, dashboards. Respond: runbooks, automation, clear ownership, escalation paths.

Communicate Plan: Align execution with stakeholders. What we're fixing now vs later: prioritize by impact and urgency. Owners and timelines: who owns what, when will it be done. Tradeoffs accepted: what risks are we explicitly accepting. Escalation paths: who to contact if things go wrong. Language that works: 'What's the blast radius if this fails?' 'How would we know this is broken at 3am?' 'What's our fastest safe rollback?'

Monitor: Keep system healthy over time. Track leading indicators: metrics that predict problems before they happen. Review incidents + near-misses: learn from failures, update processes. Update runbooks: keep documentation current as system evolves. Revisit risks regularly: quarterly risk review, update mitigation plans. Remember: Operational excellence ≠ zero failures. Operational excellence = fail small, detect fast, recover predictably."

Define scope: Product / system boundaries: what's in scope, what's out. Owners: who's on-call / accountable. SLAs / expectations: what are the performance targets? Baseline health: Availability: uptime, error rates. Performance: latency, throughput. Quality: bugs, data correctness. Operations: on-call load, manual work.

Identify Risks: Enumerate what could break. Enumerate failure modes: Technical: scaling issues, dependencies, infrastructure. Data: freshness, correctness, completeness. Process: handoffs, approvals, manual steps. People: bus factor, burnout, knowledge gaps. For each risk: Likelihood: how probable is this failure? Impact: blast radius (how many users/features affected). Detection difficulty: how fast would we notice?

Prioritize Fixes: Rank and choose actions. Rank risks by: Impact × Likelihood (high priority = high impact × high likelihood). Time-to-detect × Time-to-recover (faster detection/recovery = better). Choose actions: Prevent: design changes, architecture improvements, automation. Detect: metrics, alerts, monitoring, dashboards. Respond: runbooks, automation, clear ownership, escalation paths.

Communicate Plan: Align execution with stakeholders. What we're fixing now vs later: prioritize by impact and urgency. Owners and timelines: who owns what, when will it be done. Tradeoffs accepted: what risks are we explicitly accepting. Escalation paths: who to contact if things go wrong. Language that works: 'What's the blast radius if this fails?' 'How would we know this is broken at 3am?' 'What's our fastest safe rollback?'

Monitor: Keep system healthy over time. Track leading indicators: metrics that predict problems before they happen. Review incidents + near-misses: learn from failures, update processes. Update runbooks: keep documentation current as system evolves. Revisit risks regularly: quarterly risk review, update mitigation plans. Remember: Operational excellence ≠ zero failures. Operational excellence = fail small, detect fast, recover predictably."
