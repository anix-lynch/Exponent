4,55% of users do not complete the application from the application page to the submission page. Why do you think this is the case?,🟢,P2,North Star Metric,Define NSM → Input KPIs → Leading Indicators → Guardrails,Application funnel; 55% drop = major friction,"Define Funnel Steps: Map the exact user journey.

Step 5: Confirmation / next steps. Guardrail: Steps must be USER actions, not internal events.

Measure Drop-off: Compute conversion rate between each step. Calculate: Step 1 → 2: X%, Step 2 → 3: Y%, Step 3 → 4: Z%. Identify the largest % drop - this is the bottleneck that needs attention.

Identify Friction: Ask WHY users fail at the bottleneck step. UX friction: too many required fields, unclear instructions, time-consuming. Trust friction: unclear process, privacy concerns. Technical friction: form errors, save issues, upload problems. Use session replays, funnel by segment, and form analytics.

Hypothesize Fix: Generate 1-2 clear hypotheses. Format: If we reduce friction X, then conversion at step Y increases. Prioritize: High impact × Low effort, isolated to one step. Examples: simplify form, show value earlier, fix technical issues, improve mobile UX.

Test: Run A/B test or staged rollout. Primary metric: conversion rate at the bottleneck step. Guardrails: monitor downstream impact (retention, quality, revenue). Decide: ship winner, iterate, or rollback based on results."
