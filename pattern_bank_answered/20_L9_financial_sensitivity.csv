34,"As a leader at Spotify, how would you triple its revenue in the next three years?",🟡,L9,Financial Sensitivity,"Levers (Price, Volume, Churn) → Impact → Prioritize",Revenue growth strategy; 3× target,"Identify Levers: Determine what can move the business outcome. Price: ARPU (average revenue per user), fees, discounting, pricing tiers. Volume: Users, orders, sessions, transactions, engagement. Churn: Retention, repeat rate, lifetime value, customer lifetime. Each lever can impact revenue/profitability, but with different sensitivity and constraints.

Sensitivity Test: Assess how sensitive the outcome is to each lever. +1% Price → Δ Revenue? (price elasticity, churn risk). +1% Volume → Δ Revenue? (scalability, marginal cost). -1% Churn → Δ LTV? (lifetime value impact, compounding effect). Rule: Use direction + relative size, not exact math. Sensitivity beats precision early on. Small churn changes compound more than price hikes. Not all growth is profitable growth.

Constraints: Identify what limits each lever. Price elasticity: how much demand drops with price increase. Supply / ops limits: capacity constraints, operational bottlenecks. Market saturation: addressable market size, growth ceiling. Competitive response: how competitors react to changes. Switching costs: how easy/hard for users to leave. Regulatory / legal: pricing regulations, compliance limits.

Prioritize: Focus on highest-impact lever. High impact × low risk first: maximize outcome while minimizing downside. Short-term vs long-term split: balance immediate gains with sustainable growth. One primary lever (not all): pick one lever to lead, others to support. Quick sensitivity grid: Price: High impact, High risk, Medium control → Careful. Volume: Medium impact, Medium risk, Low control → Secondary. Churn: High impact, Low risk, High control → Primary (often). Output: 'We focus on X because it moves Y the most.' Remember: Pick one lever to lead, others to support."
