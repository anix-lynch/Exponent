# 🤖 TAGGING ALGORITHM [FOR LLM EYES ONLY]

**Purpose:** Deterministic classification of 2,893 questions into 🟢🟡🔴

**Usage:** Feed this file + ALL_QUESTIONS_NORMALIZED.md → Get bucketed output

**Approach:** Intent-based (not just keyword matching)

---

## 🧠 INTENT-BASED CLASSIFICATION (NOT FINE-TUNING)

**What this means:**
- Classify the question's **PRIMARY INTENT**, not just surface keywords
- "Squares of a sorted array" → Intent: ALGORITHM_PUZZLE → 🔴
- "How would you compute top salaries?" → Intent: REASONING → 🟡
- "Write a query for top salaries" → Intent: SYNTAX_RECALL → 🔴

**How it works:**
1. **Layer 1:** Fast keyword triggers (explicit)
2. **Layer 2:** Intent detection via semantic patterns (deterministic scoring)
3. **Boundary rules:** Handle edge cases (SQL syntax vs reasoning, etc.)

**Still deterministic. Still auditable. No model training required.**

---

**No creativity. No interpretation. Follow the tree.**

---

## ⚡ SIMPLE DECISION GUIDE

```
REJECT (🔴) if:
- Algorithm/coding question (LeetCode-style, data structures, complexity)
- Math proof or derivation
- Brain teaser

ALLOW (🟢/🟡) everything else:
- SQL questions (all types - syntax or conceptual)
- System design questions (all types - implementation or conceptual)
- Behavioral questions (all types - past stories or frameworks)
- Product/business reasoning questions
- Data analysis questions
```

**Default: If it's not algo/math/brain-teaser → proceed to pattern matching**

---

## DECISION TREE (EXECUTE IN ORDER)

```
START: Read question
│
├─ STEP 1: Check IMMEDIATE REJECT triggers
│  └─ If ANY trigger matches → 🔴 IGNORE (STOP)
│
├─ STEP 2: Check NORTHSTAR eligibility
│  ├─ Does it match a Northstar pattern? (check keywords)
│  ├─ Does it pass ALL 4 gates? (see gates below)
│  └─ If YES to both → 🟢 NORTHSTAR (STOP)
│
├─ STEP 3: Check LHF eligibility
│  ├─ Does it match an LHF pattern? (check keywords)
│  ├─ Does it pass ALL 4 gates? (see gates below)
│  └─ If YES to both → 🟡 LHF (STOP)
│
└─ STEP 4: Default
   └─ If nothing matched → 🔴 IGNORE
```

---

## STEP 1: IMMEDIATE REJECT (🔴) — INTENT-BASED

**Reject if the PRIMARY INTENT is to produce an artifact or test implementation skill.**

**Two-layer detection: Fast path (keywords) + Intent path (semantic patterns)**

---

### LAYER 1: EXPLICIT TRIGGERS (Fast Path)

**If ANY of these keywords/phrases → 🔴 immediately**

```python
# A) Code Production Verbs
EXPLICIT_CODE_VERBS = [
    "write a function", "implement", "write code", "code this",
    "write a program", "build a", "create a function",
    "develop an algorithm", "pseudocode"
]

# B) REMOVED - SQL questions are now ALLOWED (all types)

# C) Known LeetCode Problems
LEETCODE_PROBLEMS = [
    "two sum", "valid parentheses", "reverse a linked list",
    "merge k sorted", "longest substring", "climbing stairs",
    "coin change", "word break", "house robber"
]

# D) Math/Theory Production
MATH_PRODUCTION = [
    "derive the", "prove that", "proof of",
    "calculate by hand", "show the math",
    "gradient descent", "backpropagation"
]

# E) Brain Teasers
BRAIN_TEASERS = [
    "how many golf balls", "how many piano tuners",
    "estimate the weight", "riddle"
]
```

---

### LAYER 2: INTENT DETECTION (Semantic Patterns)

**Even if no explicit keywords, reject if it matches these INTENT patterns:**

#### 🔴 **INTENT A: IMPLEMENTATION_REQUIRED**

**Pattern:** Question asks to PRODUCE executable logic (not discuss it)

**Signals (if 2+ match → 🔴):**
```
✓ Contains verb+noun pair:
  - Verbs: [implement, build, create, develop, optimize, debug, refactor]
  - Nouns: [function, class, method, program, script, algorithm, data structure, parser, cache, rate limiter]
  
✓ Has input/output specification:
  - "given an array/string/tree/graph"
  - "return the"
  - "output should be"
  
✓ Mentions constraints:
  - "O(n)", "O(log n)", "time complexity"
  - "in-place", "without extra space"
  - "constraints:", "1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5"
  
✓ Problem shape (transformation):
  - "given X, find Y"
  - "determine if you can"
  - "maximize/minimize subject to"
```

**Examples caught by intent:**
- "Build a regex parser" → build + parser → 🔴
- "Create a rate limiter" → create + rate limiter → 🔴
- "Given an array, find the longest increasing subsequence" → given array + return → 🔴
- "Squares of a sorted array" → transformation problem shape → 🔴

---

#### 🔴 **INTENT B: ALGORITHM_PUZZLE**

**Pattern:** Classic CS puzzle with single correct answer

**Signals (if 2+ match → 🔴):**
```
✓ Data structure manipulation:
  - "array", "string", "tree", "graph", "linked list", "heap"
  - Combined with action: "reverse", "rotate", "merge", "sort"
  
✓ Algorithmic patterns:
  - "dynamic programming", "sliding window", "two pointers"
  - "backtracking", "greedy", "divide and conquer"
  
✓ Optimization problem:
  - "minimum/maximum number of"
  - "shortest/longest path"
  - "most/least efficient"
  
✓ Correctness focus (not judgment):
  - Single testable answer
  - No business context
  - No tradeoffs or stakeholder considerations
```

**Examples caught by intent:**
- "Knapsack problem" → optimization + no business context → 🔴
- "Find element at position in sorted array" → data structure + single answer → 🔴
- "Abbreviate an array of strings" → transformation + no judgment → 🔴

---

#### 🔴 **INTENT C: REMOVED - System Design & SQL Now Allowed**

**All system design and SQL questions are now ALLOWED.**

Only reject:
- Pure algorithm/coding questions
- Math proofs
- Brain teasers

---

#### 🔴 **INTENT D: MATHEMATICAL_PROOF**

**Pattern:** Requires deriving formulas or proving theorems

**Signals (if ANY match → 🔴):**
```
✓ Proof language:
  - "prove", "derive", "show that", "demonstrate"
  
✓ Theory depth:
  - "loss function", "gradient", "bayesian inference"
  - "probability distribution", "hypothesis testing" (when asking for math)
  - "p-value calculation", "confidence interval derivation"
```

    matched_patterns = []
    for pattern_name, pattern_data in NORTHSTAR_PATTERNS.items():
        if any(keyword in question.lower() for keyword in pattern_data["keywords"]):

    # Check Gate 2: No code required
    if contains_reject_trigger(question):

    # Gate 3 & 4: Assume true if pattern matched (validate manually if needed)
    
    # If multiple patterns match, pick primary
    primary_pattern = matched_patterns[0]  # First match wins
    
    return True, primary_pattern
```

**If ALL 4 gates pass → 🟢 NORTHSTAR**

---

## STEP 3: LHF ELIGIBILITY (🟡)

**Only check if NOT 🟢 Northstar**

### The 4 Gates (ALL must pass)

```
Gate 1: Still reasoning-first (not implementation-first)
Gate 2: Introduces domain constraints (data, finance, systems, ops)
Gate 3: Can be answered conceptually without writing code
Gate 4: Maps to a reusable secondary pattern (not one-off)
```

```

**If ALL 4 gates pass → 🟡 LHF**

---

## STEP 4: DEFAULT (🔴)

**If nothing matched in Steps 2-3 → 🔴 IGNORE**

---

## CONFLICT RESOLUTION RULES

### Priority Order (strict precedence)

```
1. IGNORE trumps everything
   - If ANY reject trigger → 🔴 (even if Northstar keywords present)

2. NORTHSTAR trumps LHF
   - If both match → 🟢

3. Multiple Northstar patterns
   - Pick first match (order: Pattern 1 → 12)

4. Multiple LHF patterns
   - Pick first match (order: LHF 1 → 14)

5. When unclear
   - Default to 🔴 IGNORE
```

### Example Conflicts

```
Q: "Write a SQL query to find orders that dropped 25%"
- Matches: Pattern #1 (Metric Drop) keywords ✓
- Matches: REJECT trigger ("write a query") ✓
→ IGNORE wins → 🔴

Q: "How would you diagnose why orders dropped and what data would you need?"
- Matches: Pattern #1 (Metric Drop) ✓
- Matches: LHF #1 (Data Trust) ✓
→ NORTHSTAR wins → 🟢 (Pattern #1)

Q: "Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL"
- Matches: No Northstar pattern ✗
- Matches: No LHF pattern ✗
→ Default → 🔴
```

## OUTPUT FORMAT

**For each question, output:**

```
Question ID: {number}
Question: {text}
Bucket: 🟢 | 🟡 | 🔴
Primary_Pattern: {Pattern name or "N/A"}
Secondary_Pattern: {Optional - only if relevant}
Reasoning: {1 sentence why}
Confidence: High | Medium | Low
```

**Example:**

```
Question ID: 42
Question: Amazon orders are down 25% — what do you do?
Bucket: 🟢
Primary_Pattern: Pattern_1_Metric_Drop
Secondary_Pattern: LHF_1_Data_Trust (if data quality is mentioned)
Reasoning: Matches metric drop keywords, no code required, reasoning-first
Confidence: High
```

**Note on Secondary Patterns:**
- Optional field — only add if question clearly involves a secondary concern
- Example: "Orders down 25% — how would you check if the data is trustworthy?" 
  - Primary: 🟢 Pattern_1_Metric_Drop
  - Secondary: 🟡 LHF_1_Data_Trust
- Keeps bucketing simple (3 buckets) but adds instructive detail

```

### Example Set 4: Edge Cases & Conflicts

```
31. "Orders dropped 25% — write a SQL query to investigate"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: Has Northstar keywords BUT "write a query" trigger → IGNORE wins

32. "How would you conceptually join these two datasets?"
    → 🟡 LHF_13_SQL_Reasoning
    Reason: "Conceptually" + no "write a query" → LHF (not code)

33. "Design a high-level architecture for a data pipeline"
    → 🟡 LHF_14_System_Design_Conceptual
    Reason: "High-level" + no implementation → LHF

34. "Design a data pipeline and write the ETL code"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: "Write the code" trigger → IGNORE

35. "How would you explain this metric drop to executives?"
    → 🟢 Pattern_10_Exec_Comm
    Reason: Primary intent is exec communication (not metric diagnosis)

36. "Diagnose why churn increased and present to the CEO"
    → 🟢 Pattern_4_Cohort_Retention
    Reason: Primary intent is diagnosis (exec comm is secondary)

37. "What's your approach to prioritization?"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: Abstract/generic, no specific scenario (not pattern-matchable)

38. "Tell me about a time you prioritized competing features"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: Behavioral (past story), not framework question

39. "How do you handle ambiguity?"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: Abstract/generic, no specific scenario

40. "You have unclear requirements for a new feature — what do you do?"
    → 🟢 Pattern_9_Uncertainty
    Reason: Specific scenario, decision under uncertainty

41. "Estimate the market size for electric scooters"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: Estimation/market sizing, not a reusable pattern

42. "How would you segment the electric scooter market?"
    → 🟢 Pattern_5_Segmentation
    Reason: Segmentation framework applies

43. "What metrics would you track for a new product?"
    → 🟢 Pattern_2_NSM_KPI
    Reason: Metric definition, NSM + KPI framework

44. "Track this metric using SQL"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: "Using SQL" implies implementation

45. "How would you know if this A/B test result is valid?"
    → 🟢 Pattern_8_Experiment
    Reason: Experiment interpretation, causal reasoning

46. "Calculate the p-value for this A/B test"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: Math calculation, not reasoning

47. "What would you do if stakeholders disagree on priorities?"
    → 🟢 Pattern_11_Influence
    Reason: Stakeholder alignment, influence pattern

48. "How do you communicate with stakeholders?"
    → 🔴 IGNORE
    Reason: Abstract/generic, no specific scenario

49. "Design a dashboard for executives"
    → 🟡 LHF_5_Observability
    Reason: Monitoring/metrics, but not Northstar (too narrow)

50. "What's the most important metric for a marketplace?"
    → 🟢 Pattern_2_NSM_KPI
    Reason: North Star Metric question
