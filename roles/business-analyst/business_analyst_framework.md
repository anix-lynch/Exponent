## 🎯 How to USE this in interviews

When a question comes:

1. **Name the category silently**
2. **Apply that category's framework**
3. Speak in **structured bullets**

---

## 0️⃣ Core Interview Meta-Structure (applies to EVERYTHING)

No matter the category, interviewers are testing:

- **Business acumen** - Do you understand the business context?
- **Analytical thinking** - Can you break down complex problems?
- **Communication** - Can you explain insights to non-technical stakeholders?
- **Impact focus** - Do you connect analysis to business outcomes?

So every answer should follow this shape:

```
Understand business context → Analyze data → Generate insights → Recommend action → Measure impact
```
