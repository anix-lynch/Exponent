## 🔟 How to USE this in interviews

When a question comes:

1. **Name the category silently**
2. **Apply that category's framework**
3. **Speak in structured bullets**

---

## 0️⃣ Core Interview Meta-Structure (applies to EVERYTHING)

No matter the category, interviewers are testing:

- **Program thinking** (not just project execution)
- **Cross-functional leadership**
- **Technical depth + business acumen**
- **Stakeholder management**

So every answer should follow this shape:

```
Clarify → Plan → Execute → Measure → Scale
```
