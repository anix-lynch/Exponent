## 🎯 How to USE this in interviews

When a question comes:

1. **Name the category silently**
2. **Apply that category's framework**
3. Speak in **structured bullets**

---

## 0️⃣ Core Interview Meta-Structure (applies to EVERYTHING)

No matter the category, interviewers are testing:

- **Product thinking** - Do you understand how products work and what makes them successful?
- **Analytical rigor** - Can you use data to answer product questions?
- **User empathy** - Do you understand user needs and behavior?
- **Business impact** - Do you connect analysis to product and business outcomes?

So every answer should follow this shape:

```
Understand the product → Analyze the data → Generate insights → Recommend action → Measure impact
```
