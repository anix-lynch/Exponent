## 🔟 How to USE this in interviews

When a question comes:

1. **Name the category silently**
2. **Apply that category's framework**
3. Speak in **structured bullets**

---

## 0️⃣ Core Interview Meta-Structure (applies to EVERYTHING)

No matter the category, interviewers are testing:

- **Clarity of thinking**
- **Structure before details**
- **Tradeoffs**
- **Business impact**

So every answer should follow this shape:

```
Clarify → Break down → Analyze → Decide → Communicate impact
```

---
