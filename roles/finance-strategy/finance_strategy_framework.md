## 💡 Final Tips

### For All Finance & Strategy Interviews:

1. **Think like a CFO** - Focus on profitability, efficiency, and growth
2. **Use frameworks** - SWOT, Porter's 5 Forces, Unit Economics, etc.
3. **Be hypothesis-driven** - Start with a hypothesis, then validate with data
4. **Communicate clearly** - Finance people often present to non-finance stakeholders
5. **Show business acumen** - Understand how finance enables business strategy

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:

- ❌ Being too theoretical - use real examples and numbers
- ❌ Ignoring constraints - always consider budget, time, resources
- ❌ Forgetting the "so what?" - explain business impact
- ❌ Overcomplicating - simple, clear analysis is better than complex models
